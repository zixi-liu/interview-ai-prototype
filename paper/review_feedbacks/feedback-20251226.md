# Paper Review Feedback

**Paper:** Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Interview Evaluation: Limitations and Enhancements  
**Review Date:** 2025-12-26  
**Reviewer:** Systematic Review Based on Review Guidelines  
**Recommendation:** **Minor Revision Required**

---

## 1. Summary

This paper investigates the application of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for behavioral interview answer evaluation and improvement through two controlled experiments with 50 behavioral interview Q&A pairs. The paper presents three key contributions: (1) quantitative comparison of human-in-the-loop vs. automated CoT improvement showing comparable rating improvements but significant training benefits for human-in-the-loop, (2) convergence analysis demonstrating rapid convergence (mean <1 iteration) with diminishing returns, and (3) adversarial challenging mechanism design (`bar_raiser`) for realistic evaluation. The paper has been substantially improved since the previous review, with quantitative evidence now properly integrated from Experiments 1 and 2. However, some minor issues remain regarding citation formatting, figure integration, and clarity of certain technical details.

## 2. Strengths

1. **Strong Quantitative Evidence**: The paper now includes comprehensive quantitative results from two controlled experiments (n=50), with proper statistical analysis including paired t-tests, effect sizes (Cohen's d, Cohen's h), and proper reporting of p-values. All claims are substantiated by experimental data.

2. **Clear Experimental Design**: The within-subject paired design is well-justified and properly implemented, with counterbalancing to control for order effects. The methodology section (3.1.5) provides detailed experimental procedures that enable reproducibility.

3. **Honest Limitations Discussion**: The paper appropriately acknowledges limitations, including moderate improvement rates (38-36%), non-significant difference in rating improvement (p=0.705), and the lack of quantitative validation for Finding 3 (adversarial challenging mechanism).

4. **Comprehensive Related Work**: The Related Work section has been significantly expanded with 22 citations covering CoT prompting, human-in-the-loop systems, LLM evaluation, interview systems, and prompt engineering. The positioning of this work is clear.

5. **Well-Structured Presentation**: The paper follows a logical structure with clear separation between Findings (qualitative insights) and Results (quantitative data). Tables are well-formatted and statistical tests are properly reported.

6. **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**: The paper goes beyond simple rating improvement to evaluate training effectiveness, efficiency, and customization, providing a more comprehensive assessment of the approaches.

## 3. Critical Weaknesses

### 3.1 Citation Formatting Issues (MINOR)

**Issue:** Some citations in the Related Work section may need verification for accuracy and completeness.

**Specific Problems:**
- Citations are provided but some may need page numbers or more complete publication information
- Some citations reference conference proceedings that may need full venue names
- Consider adding DOIs or arXiv numbers where applicable

**Recommendation:** Verify all citations against original sources and ensure they follow the target venue's citation format.

### 3.2 Figure Integration (MINOR)

**Issue:** Figure 2 is referenced but not embedded in the paper.

**Specific Problems:**
- Figure 2 (success rate by iteration) is mentioned in text and appendix but not shown
- The visualization file exists (`exp2_results/analysis/exp2_success_rate_by_iteration.png`) but should be integrated into the paper

**Recommendation:** Include Figure 2 in the Results section (5.2.1) to visualize convergence behavior. This would strengthen the presentation and make the convergence findings more accessible.

### 3.3 Minor Statistical Reporting Inconsistencies (MINOR)

**Issue:** Some minor inconsistencies in statistical reporting across sections.

**Specific Problems:**
- In some places, n_paired=49 is reported, while n=50 is used elsewhere. The paper correctly notes that one participant had missing data, but this could be mentioned more consistently.
- The independent t-test for iteration comparison (Table 3) is correctly used, but the rationale for using independent vs. paired test could be briefly explained (since these are between-treatment comparisons, not within-subject).

**Recommendation:** Add a brief note explaining why independent t-test is appropriate for iteration comparison (comparing between treatments, not within subjects).

### 3.4 Model Validation Details (MINOR)

**Issue:** The multi-model validation (Gemini 3.0 Pro, GPT-5.2 Thinking) is mentioned but results are not reported.

**Specific Problems:**
- Section 3.1.4 mentions validation on 20% and 10% of answers but no results are presented
- It's unclear whether the validation confirmed or contradicted the main findings

**Recommendation:** Either report the validation results briefly (even if in appendix) or clarify that validation was for robustness checking and results were consistent (if that's the case). If results differed, this should be discussed.

## 11. Final Comments

This paper represents a significant improvement from the previous version. The integration of quantitative evidence from Experiments 1 and 2 is excellent, statistical analysis is rigorous, and the paper appropriately distinguishes between empirically validated findings and design contributions. The within-subject paired design is well-justified and properly implemented.

The remaining issues are minor and primarily relate to presentation (figure integration, citation formatting) and minor clarifications (statistical test rationale, model validation reporting). These can be addressed quickly without requiring additional experiments or major restructuring.

The paper makes solid contributions to the field of AI-assisted interview preparation, providing quantitative evidence for the value proposition of human-in-the-loop approaches and demonstrating rapid convergence behavior in structured evaluation domains. The honest discussion of limitations and appropriate framing of the design contribution (Finding 3) strengthen the paper's credibility.

With the minor revisions addressed, this paper should be ready for submission to a top-tier venue.
