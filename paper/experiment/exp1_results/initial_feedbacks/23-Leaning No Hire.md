## Question

How would you design/test a product to make sure its diverse/inclusive to all users?

## Answer

Situation: In my previous role at a software development company, we were creating a new health and fitness app. Early in the design phase, it became apparent that our initial user interface and content did not adequately address the diverse needs and experiences of all potential users, including those with disabilities and from various cultural backgrounds.  Task: My task was to lead the effort in redesigning and testing the app to ensure it was inclusive and accessible to a broad user base, including people with different abilities and from diverse cultural backgrounds.  Action: To address this, I initiated a comprehensive review of our design and development process. I advocated for and implemented the following actions:  User Research: Conducted extensive user research to understand the needs and preferences of a diverse user group. This included surveys, interviews, and focus groups with participants of varied ages, abilities, and cultural backgrounds.  Inclusive Design Principles: Integrated inclusive design principles into our development process. This involved considering factors such as color contrast for visually impaired users, text size options, and culturally sensitive content.  Diverse Testing Team: Assembled a diverse group of beta testers who could provide feedback from different perspectives. This group included people with disabilities, non-native English speakers, and users from various age groups and cultural backgrounds.  Accessibility Standards: Ensured that the app met international accessibility standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).  Regular Feedback Loops: Established regular feedback loops during the development cycle to incorporate user input into the design continually.  Result: The revised app received positive feedback for its inclusivity and user-friendly design. Users particularly appreciated features such as adjustable text sizes, high-contrast color schemes, and culturally diverse content. This approach not only broadened our market reach but also positively impacted our brand image. The project taught me the importance of empathy in design, the value of diverse perspectives in developing products, and the need for ongoing user engagement to create truly inclusive software solutions.

6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 🤔 Leaning No Hire

The candidate demonstrated a solid understanding of inclusive design and structured thinking, but the lack of clear metrics and personal ownership in the redesign process raises concerns. In a competitive hiring environment, more explicit evidence of impact and individual contribution is necessary to meet the expectations for this level.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide specific metrics or data that demonstrate the impact of the changes you implemented in the app?
2. What specific actions did you take personally during the redesign process, and how did they differ from your team's contributions?
3. How did you measure the success of the user research and feedback loops you established?
4. Can you describe a challenge you faced during the redesign and how you overcame it?
5. What steps did you take to ensure that the diverse beta testers provided meaningful feedback?
6. How did you prioritize the different inclusive design features you implemented in the app?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "overclaiming contribution" - The candidate describes leading the effort but does not specify their individual contributions versus team efforts.
  - "lack of reflection" - The candidate does not discuss any challenges faced or lessons learned from the process, which limits insight into their personal growth and adaptability.

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "overclaiming contribution" - ★★☆☆☆
- "lack of reflection" - ★★☆☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's ownership of the project is ambiguous, as it is unclear what specific actions they personally took versus those taken by the team.
- There is a lack of reflection on challenges faced, which diminishes the perceived depth of their experience and learning.
- Overall, the response lacks sufficient detail to demonstrate clear, impactful contributions.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly delineate personal contributions versus team efforts to avoid ambiguity.
- Include specific challenges encountered during the project and how they were addressed to demonstrate problem-solving skills.
- Reflect on lessons learned to show personal growth and adaptability in the design process.
