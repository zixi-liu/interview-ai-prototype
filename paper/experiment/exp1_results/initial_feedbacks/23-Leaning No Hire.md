## Question

How would you design/test a product to make sure its diverse/inclusive to all users?

## Answer

In my previous role as the lead engineer for a health and fitness app, I spearheaded a comprehensive redesign initiative to enhance inclusivity and accessibility for our diverse user base. Recognizing the importance of creating an app that resonates with various demographics, I took full ownership of the project and initiated a robust user research program. This included conducting over 200 surveys, 15 in-depth interviews, and three focus groups specifically targeting individuals with disabilities and non-native English speakers. Through this research, I identified critical pain points, such as navigation difficulties and the lack of culturally relevant content, which I prioritized for immediate resolution.

To address these challenges, I led my team in embedding inclusive design principles throughout the development lifecycle. I personally drove the implementation of key features, including adjustable text sizes, high-contrast color schemes, and culturally sensitive content, ensuring compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). I made strategic trade-offs by prioritizing features that maximized user experience while aligning with our technical capabilities and development timelines, which directly supported the company’s broader business objectives.

To validate our design choices, I established and led a diverse beta testing group of 30 individuals, conducting bi-weekly feedback sessions that I facilitated. I actively engaged with participants, fostering an environment of open dialogue to gather their insights. This iterative feedback process was crucial; I meticulously analyzed their responses, which directly informed a significant redesign of our navigation structure. As a result of my leadership, we achieved a 50% reduction in user-reported navigation issues and a 40% increase in overall usability ratings across all demographics.

The impact of my leadership in this initiative was substantial. We recorded a 40% increase in user satisfaction ratings and a 30% boost in downloads within the first month of launch, significantly broadening our market reach and enhancing our brand image. Throughout the project, I faced challenges in balancing feature requests with technical constraints, particularly when navigating conflicting priorities between accessibility features and performance optimizations. By fostering a culture of collaboration and maintaining clear communication with my team and stakeholders, I effectively navigated these challenges, ensuring our solutions met both user needs and business objectives.

This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of empathy in design and the value of diverse perspectives in creating products that serve all users. I am committed to fostering an inclusive culture in every team I join, leveraging my proactive leadership and collaboration skills to drive measurable outcomes. My focus on clear ownership and accountability, coupled with a data-driven approach to decision-making, ensures that I contribute effectively to both team success and organizational goals. I have learned that true leadership involves not only guiding a team but also embracing feedback and continuously evolving to meet the needs of all users, which I will carry forward into future projects.
