## Question

Assume you are given a task to design a system. How would you do it? How would you resolve ambiguity?

## Answer

When given a task to design a system, my approach involves several key steps to ensure clarity and effectiveness in the design process. Firstly, I start with requirement gathering. This involves discussing with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations from the system. I ask detailed questions to clarify the scope and functionality required. For instance, in a previous project, I prepared a comprehensive list of questions that helped identify specific features and performance criteria expected from the system. After gathering initial requirements, I conduct a feasibility study and research. This helps in understanding the technical aspects, such as the appropriate technology stack, and any constraints or regulatory compliance requirements. Next, I draft an initial design proposal. This typically includes outlining the system architecture, data flow diagrams, and a basic prototype or wireframe of the user interface. This step is crucial for visualizing how different components of the system will interact and function. Resolving ambiguity is a key part of the process. I do this by setting up review meetings with stakeholders where I present my initial design and gather feedback. These discussions are essential for clarifying any vague requirements and aligning the design with the stakeholders' vision. I take detailed notes and make sure to address each point of ambiguity with concrete information or alternatives. Once the design is refined and agreed upon, I create detailed documentation, including technical specifications, user stories, and workflow diagrams. This serves as a guide for the development team and ensures everyone is on the same page. Throughout the process, effective communication, continuous collaboration with stakeholders, and being open to feedback are my top priorities. This approach not only ensures a clear understanding of the project requirements but also facilitates the creation of a system that truly meets the users' needs.

## Feedback

============================================================
1. Real-Time Raw Notes (Interviewer's scratch notes)
- Requirement gathering first
- Stakeholder discussions, detailed questions
- Previous project example, list of questions
- Feasibility study, tech stack, compliance
- Initial design proposal: architecture, data flow, wireframe
- Review meetings for feedback, clarify ambiguity
- Detailed documentation: specs, user stories, workflows
- Emphasis on communication, collaboration, feedback

============================================================
2. Formal Interview Summary (for hiring committee)
The candidate outlined a structured approach to system design, beginning with requirement gathering through stakeholder discussions. They emphasized the importance of clarifying ambiguity via review meetings and feedback loops. While the process described is methodical, the candidate's examples lacked specific metrics or measurable outcomes, which is critical for assessing impact. Overall, the response demonstrated a solid understanding of the design process but fell short in showcasing personal ownership and the scope of their contributions.

============================================================
3. Strengths (Interviewer perspective)
- Clear understanding of system design process
- Structured approach to requirement gathering
- Emphasis on stakeholder communication and feedback
- Ability to create initial design proposals and documentation

============================================================
4. Areas for Improvement
- Need to demonstrate personal ownership and impact on previous projects more clearly
- Provide specific metrics or outcomes to quantify the success of design efforts
- Clarify the scope of contributions to avoid executor-style responses

============================================================
5. Competency Ratings (use FAANG rubric)
- Ownership: Below(🤔)
- Problem Solving: Meets(👌)
- Execution: Meets(👌)
- Collaboration: Meets+(👍)
- Communication: Meets+(👍)
- Leadership / Influence: Below(🤔)
- Culture Fit: Meets(👌)

============================================================
6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 🤔 Leaning No Hire

The candidate demonstrated a solid understanding of the system design process but lacked clear ownership and measurable impact in their examples. The absence of specific metrics and a strong personal contribution to past projects raises concerns about their readiness for the role at this level.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide a specific example of how your design decisions impacted the project's success? What metrics did you use to measure that impact?
2. In your previous project, how did you ensure that your contributions were clearly defined and recognized by your team?
3. Describe a situation where a stakeholder's feedback significantly changed your design. How did you handle that, and what was the outcome?
4. What challenges did you face during the requirement gathering phase, and how did you overcome them?
5. How do you prioritize conflicting requirements from different stakeholders in your design process? Can you give an example?
6. Can you discuss a time when you had to advocate for a specific design choice? What was the result?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "executor-style contribution" - The candidate describes a process but lacks clear ownership of specific outcomes or decisions.
  - "vagueness" - The answer does not provide concrete examples of metrics or quantifiable results from previous projects.

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "executor-style contribution": ★★★☆☆
- "vagueness": ★★★☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate outlines a systematic approach but fails to demonstrate personal ownership of outcomes.
- Lacks specific metrics or results that validate the effectiveness of their design process.
- Overall, the response does not sufficiently reflect Junior-Mid-level impact or clarity.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions (very concise)
- Provide specific examples of past projects with measurable outcomes or impacts.
- Clearly articulate personal contributions and decisions made during the design process.
- Include metrics or data that influenced design choices to demonstrate data-driven decision-making.
