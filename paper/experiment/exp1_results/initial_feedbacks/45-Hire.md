## Question

Tell me about a time when you had a hard time working with someone in your team. How did you handle it?

## Answer

Situation: In my previous role as a software engineer, I was part of a team developing a new mobile application. One of our team members, let's call him John, had a very different working style from the rest of the team. John was highly skilled but often worked in isolation, which sometimes led to misalignment with the team's progress and objectives. Task: My task was not only to ensure the project's success but also to foster a collaborative and cohesive team environment. It was essential to address the issue without causing any interpersonal conflict or negatively impacting the team's morale. Action: I initiated a one-on-one meeting with John to understand his perspective and work habits. During our conversation, I emphasized the team's goals and how each member's contributions were critical. I also shared feedback about how his working style was impacting the team dynamics and project progress. To bridge the gap, I proposed more frequent check-ins and collaborative sessions, ensuring they were structured to respect his work preferences as much as possible. Additionally, I arranged a few team-building activities to enhance mutual understanding and camaraderie among all team members. Result: John appreciated the open communication and was willing to adapt his working style for the benefit of the team. The increased interaction and understanding among team members led to a more synchronized workflow. The project was completed successfully, with the client praising not only our work but also our team dynamics. This experience taught me valuable lessons in handling diverse work styles and the importance of empathy and clear communication in team management.
