# Red Flag Evaluation (20251225)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a time when you had a hard time working with someone in your team. How did you handle it?

## Answer

In my previous role as a software engineer, I led a cross-functional team tasked with developing a mobile application under a tight deadline. Early in the project, I identified that one of my team members, John, had a working style that was primarily focused on individual tasks rather than collaborative efforts, which was misaligned with our project objectives. Recognizing the potential impact on our timeline and success, I took full ownership of the situation and initiated a proactive approach to address the misalignment.

I scheduled a one-on-one meeting with John to understand his perspective and working habits better. During our conversation, I clearly articulated how his approach was affecting not only his productivity but also the overall team dynamics. I actively listened to his concerns, which allowed me to adapt my communication style to ensure he felt valued and understood. This open dialogue was crucial in fostering a sense of trust and collaboration.

To facilitate better alignment, I implemented structured weekly check-ins, where we reviewed progress against our shared goals and established clear accountability. I also introduced targeted team-building activities that were designed to enhance trust and communication among all team members. I took the lead in these sessions, ensuring they were engaging and directly relevant to our project objectives.

As a result of these initiatives, we achieved a 50% increase in our collaborative output, as measured by the number of completed tasks in our project management tool. This improvement allowed us to complete the project two weeks ahead of schedule, which directly contributed to a 20% increase in client satisfaction ratings, as reflected in their feedback praising both the quality of the application and the enhanced teamwork throughout the development process.

To maintain alignment and accountability, I established a shared digital dashboard that tracked progress and allowed team members to provide real-time updates. This tool was instrumental in ensuring that everyone remained engaged and informed throughout the project lifecycle.

This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of empathy, proactive communication, and adaptability in leadership. I learned to regularly assess team dynamics and take responsibility for fostering a collaborative environment. By decisively owning the situation and implementing these changes, I ensured our project not only met but exceeded expectations. This has equipped me with the skills necessary to navigate complex team interactions and drive successful project outcomes, aligning closely with the values and expectations of a senior role in a FAANG company.
