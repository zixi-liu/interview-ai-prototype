**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Describe a time when you had to work simultaneously on both high-priority urgent projects as well as long-term projects. How did you go about handling both?

## Answer

In my previous role as a software developer, I encountered a pivotal moment where I had to manage a critical client issue on a live product while simultaneously advancing a long-term strategic software development project that I was leading. Taking complete ownership of both initiatives, I conducted a thorough analysis of each project's urgency and potential impact, utilizing a scoring system that factored in client impact, revenue implications, and strategic alignment. This allowed me to prioritize effectively, ensuring that the immediate client issue was addressed without jeopardizing the long-term project.

To manage these competing priorities, I developed a detailed action plan. I created a Gantt chart for the long-term project to visualize timelines and milestones, while employing a Kanban board to monitor the urgent issue's progress. I led prioritization meetings with the team, where I presented data-driven insights to justify our decisions, fostering a collaborative environment that aligned everyone on our objectives.

Recognizing the importance of leveraging my team's strengths, I delegated specific tasks based on individual capabilities. For instance, I assigned a team member with strong analytical skills to conduct data analysis for the client issue, which allowed me to concentrate on strategic decision-making and stakeholder communication. I ensured that my contributions were clear by actively participating in discussions and making key decisions, such as adjusting project timelines based on real-time feedback.

To maintain momentum on the urgent client issue, I instituted daily stand-up meetings that I facilitated, encouraging open communication and promptly addressing any blockers. I also dedicated focused hours each day to the long-term project, driving critical development tasks and collaborating closely with stakeholders to gather feedback and iterate on our approach. My proactive engagement ensured that the team felt supported and empowered.

As a result of this structured and hands-on approach, we resolved the client issue within a week, restoring client trust and leading to a 30% increase in their satisfaction ratings based on follow-up surveys. Simultaneously, the long-term project remained on schedule, achieving key milestones, including a successful beta launch that received positive feedback from stakeholders, evidenced by a 25% increase in user engagement metrics post-launch and a 15% increase in projected revenue from the new features.

This experience reinforced my understanding of prioritization and agile responses, while also highlighting the importance of clear communication and adaptive leadership. I learned to be more proactive and engaged in my leadership style, ensuring that my team felt supported and empowered to deliver exceptional results. Moving forward, I am committed to applying these lessons to drive both immediate and long-term success in future projects, leveraging my ability to balance urgent needs with strategic goals effectively.
