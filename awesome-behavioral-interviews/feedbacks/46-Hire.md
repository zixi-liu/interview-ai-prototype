# Red Flag Evaluation (20251221)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a project that didn’t go according to plan.

## Answer

Situation: In my previous role as a software developer at a tech company, we embarked on a project to develop a new customer relationship management (CRM) system. The goal was to streamline our sales process and improve customer interactions.  Task: My responsibility was to lead the backend development team and ensure our components integrated seamlessly with the front-end system and the database.  Action: We followed an agile methodology and had regular sprints. However, partway through the development cycle, we encountered significant issues. The project was falling behind schedule due to unexpected technical challenges and integration problems with third-party services. Realizing the gravity of the situation, I took the initiative to re-evaluate our project plan. I organized a series of meetings with my team, the front-end team, and stakeholders to reassess our approach. We identified key bottlenecks and realized that our initial technical assessment underestimated the complexity of integrating various APIs. I advocated for a revised plan that included a shift in technology stack for certain components and allocated additional resources to tackle the integration challenges.  Result: This strategic pivot was a turning point. Although the project was initially delayed, the new approach allowed us to overcome the technical hurdles and deliver a more robust CRM system. In the end, the project was considered a success, with the CRM system enhancing our sales team's efficiency by 25%. The experience taught me valuable lessons in project management, the importance of agility in problem-solving, and proactive communication with all stakeholders.
