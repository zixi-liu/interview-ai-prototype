**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Describe a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback. How did you handle it?

## Answer

Situation: While working as a senior software developer at a tech company, I was mentoring a junior developer, let's call him Alex. Alex was enthusiastic and talented, but I noticed that his code often lacked proper documentation, which is crucial for our team's workflow and long-term project maintenance.  Task: My task was to provide Alex with this critical feedback in a way that was constructive and encouraging, without discouraging his enthusiasm and confidence.  Action: I arranged a one-on-one meeting with Alex to discuss his recent work. I started by acknowledging the strengths in his coding skills and the value he brought to the team. Then, I gently introduced the issue of the lack of documentation in his code. I explained the importance of comprehensive documentation, not only for the current team but also for any future developers who might work on the project. To guide him, I provided examples of well-documented code and offered to share resources and best practices on effective documentation. I made sure to keep the tone of the conversation positive and focused on growth and learning.  Result: Alex responded well to the feedback. He understood the importance of documentation and began to improve in this area. Over the next few projects, there was a noticeable enhancement in his code documentation. He even thanked me later for the feedback, acknowledging how it helped him become a better developer. This experience underscored the importance of delivering feedback in a constructive manner, focusing on growth and learning, and the value of mentorship in a team's development.
