**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a time when you had an excessive amount of work and you knew you could not meet the deadline. How did you manage then?

## Answer

Situation: While working as a software developer at a tech startup, we were in the final stages of launching a new feature. A week before the deadline, we received feedback from beta testing that indicated significant issues with user experience. This required additional work that was not accounted for in our initial planning.  Task: My task was to address these issues and implement the necessary changes. However, given the amount of work and the complexity of the tasks, it was clear that meeting the original deadline would be extremely challenging.  Action: I took several steps to manage this situation:  Reassessing Priorities: I quickly reassessed the tasks based on their urgency and importance. I focused on critical issues that directly impacted functionality and user experience.  Communicating with Stakeholders: I immediately communicated the situation to my manager and the project stakeholders. I was transparent about the challenges and the potential delay in the deadline. I provided a revised estimate based on a realistic assessment of the situation.  Seeking Assistance: I coordinated with my team to redistribute the workload effectively. We also identified areas where we could seek additional help, either from other teams or by temporarily bringing in extra resources.  Maximizing Efficiency: I reprioritized my workload, focusing on the most critical tasks first. I also extended my work hours and streamlined my working process to increase productivity.  Regular Updates: Throughout this period, I provided regular updates to the management and stakeholders about our progress and any changes in the timeline.  Result: Through these efforts, we were able to address all the critical issues identified in the beta testing. We missed the original deadline but managed to release the feature only two days later. The feature was well-received by users, and the feedback on the improvements was overwhelmingly positive. This situation taught me valuable lessons in prioritization, transparent communication, and the importance of flexibility and adaptability in a dynamic work environment. It also highlighted the significance of teamwork and effective resource management under tight deadlines.
