**Rating**: Leaning_No_Hire

## Question

Describe a time you received tough or critical feedback

## Answer

Situation: In my role as a software developer at a tech company, we had just completed a major phase of a project where I was responsible for developing a key component of the application. During our review meeting, my manager provided critical feedback on my work.  Task: The feedback was regarding the performance inefficiencies in the code I had written. My task was not only to address the specific issue but also to demonstrate my ability to respond constructively to critical feedback.  Action: Initially, I was surprised as I had put significant effort into the project. However, I recognized the importance of embracing constructive criticism to improve. I requested more details to understand the specific concerns. I then took time to thoroughly review my code and identified areas where performance could be optimized. I also reached out to a more experienced colleague for advice on best practices in performance optimization. Over the next week, I worked on revising the code, implementing more efficient algorithms, and reducing unnecessary complexity. Additionally, I volunteered to attend a workshop on advanced performance optimization techniques to further enhance my skills.  Result: The revised code significantly improved the application's performance, receiving positive feedback from both my manager and the client. This experience taught me the value of constructive feedback as a tool for professional growth. It also highlighted the importance of continuous learning and collaboration in software development. Responding positively to this tough feedback not only improved the project outcome but also helped me develop as a more skilled and adaptable developer.

## Feedback

============================================================
1. Real-Time Raw Notes (Interviewer's scratch notes)
- Role: Software developer, tech company
- Critical feedback on performance inefficiencies
- Surprised but embraced feedback
- Asked for details, reviewed code
- Collaborated with experienced colleague
- Revised code, improved algorithms
- Attended workshop for skills enhancement
- Result: improved performance, positive feedback
- Learning: value of feedback, continuous learning

============================================================
2. Formal Interview Summary (for hiring committee)
The candidate described a situation where they received critical feedback regarding performance inefficiencies in their code during a project review. They demonstrated a proactive approach by seeking clarification on the feedback, reviewing their work, and collaborating with a more experienced colleague to optimize their code. The candidate also took the initiative to attend a workshop to further enhance their skills. The result was a significant improvement in application performance, which was well-received by both their manager and the client. This experience illustrates the candidate's ability to respond constructively to feedback and their commitment to continuous learning.

============================================================
3. Strengths (Interviewer perspective)
- Demonstrated ability to accept and act on feedback
- Proactive in seeking clarification and support
- Willingness to learn and improve skills through workshops
- Positive outcome from revisions indicates reliability

============================================================
4. Areas for Improvement
- Could provide more specific metrics on performance improvements
- Scope of impact primarily limited to individual contribution; needs to demonstrate broader ownership

============================================================
5. Competency Ratings (use FAANG rubric)
- Ownership: Meets(👌)
- Problem Solving: Meets+(👍)
- Execution: Meets(👌)
- Collaboration: Meets+(👍)
- Communication: Meets(👌)
- Leadership / Influence: Below(🤔)
- Culture Fit: Meets(👌)

============================================================
6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 🤔 Leaning No Hire

The candidate showed a reasonable ability to respond to feedback and improve their work, but the lack of specific metrics and broader ownership limits their impact. The execution is solid, but the overall contribution feels more like an individual effort rather than a collaborative or leadership-driven initiative, which is critical at this level.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide specific metrics or data that demonstrate the performance improvements achieved after your code revisions?
2. How did you ensure that your changes aligned with the overall project goals and team objectives?
3. Can you describe a situation where you had to advocate for your changes or ideas to the team or stakeholders?
4. What steps did you take to ensure that the feedback you received was effectively communicated to your team?
5. How do you typically approach collaboration with colleagues when working on a project? Can you give an example?
6. In what ways do you plan to further develop your leadership skills in future projects?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "lack of reflection" (candidate mentions surprise at feedback without demonstrating prior self-assessment)
  - "ambiguity avoidance" (vague on specific performance metrics or improvements made)
  - "executor-style contribution" (focus on actions taken without clear ownership of the initial problem)

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "lack of reflection": ★★☆☆☆
- "ambiguity avoidance": ★★☆☆☆
- "executor-style contribution": ★★★☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- Candidate shows initial surprise at feedback, indicating a potential lack of self-awareness.
- The response lacks specific metrics to quantify the improvements made to the code.
- Actions described are more reactive than proactive, suggesting limited ownership of the original issue.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Include specific metrics or performance benchmarks before and after the changes made to the code.
- Reflect on personal contributions and learning from the feedback to demonstrate self-awareness.
- Clarify ownership of the initial problem and the impact of the revisions on the project as a whole.
