**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a significant change at work. How did you adapt to this change?

## Answer

Situation: At my previous position as a software developer in a large tech company, our team was informed that we would be transitioning from our traditional monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture. This was a substantial shift in our approach to software development and required learning new technologies and methodologies.  Task: As someone who had primarily worked with monolithic architectures, my task was not only to quickly upskill myself in microservices but also to contribute effectively to the transition process.  Action: I took a proactive approach to this challenge. I started by enrolling in an online course on microservices architecture to build a solid theoretical understanding. Simultaneously, I spent time outside of work hours experimenting with creating small microservices to gain practical experience. I also joined study groups within the company where we shared knowledge and best practices. To stay updated, I followed industry experts on social media and participated in relevant webinars and workshops. Throughout this transition, I maintained open communication with my team and manager, sharing my progress and seeking feedback.  Result: This proactive and immersive approach enabled me to adapt quickly to the change. Within a few months, I was actively contributing to the design and development of microservices for our projects. My ability to adapt and learn rapidly was recognized by my peers and superiors, and I was given the responsibility to lead a key microservice module in one of our major projects. The transition to microservices significantly improved our team's efficiency and the scalability of our applications. This experience was immensely rewarding as it not only enhanced my technical skills but also demonstrated my adaptability and eagerness to embrace new challenges.
