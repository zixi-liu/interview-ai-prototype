**Rating**: Leaning_No_Hire

## Question

Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with your manager.

## Answer

Situation: At my previous job as a software engineer, I once found myself in disagreement with my manager over the approach to a new feature in our software application. My manager wanted to implement the feature using a certain technology stack that I believed was not the best choice for our long-term goals.  Task: My task was to effectively communicate my concerns and suggest an alternative approach that I believed was more beneficial for the project.  Action: I requested a one-on-one meeting with my manager to discuss this issue in detail. Before the meeting, I prepared a comprehensive comparison of the two technology stacks, highlighting aspects like long-term maintainability, performance, compatibility with our existing systems, and overall impact on the project timeline. During the meeting, I presented my findings in a respectful and concise manner, emphasizing my commitment to the project's success and the team's efficiency. I also made it clear that I respected his experience and perspective and was open to further discussion and compromise.  Result: My manager appreciated the thorough analysis and was impressed with the initiative I had taken to research the alternatives. After further discussion and consultation with the team, we decided to adopt a hybrid approach, incorporating elements from both our suggestions. This incident not only led to a more robust solution for our project but also strengthened my relationship with my manager. It taught me the importance of open communication, thorough preparation, and respect for different viewpoints in resolving professional disagreements.

1. Real-Time Raw Notes (Interviewer's scratch notes)
- Disagreement with manager on tech stack
- Prepared analysis for meeting
- Respectful communication
- Hybrid approach adopted
- Strengthened relationship with manager
- Importance of open communication
============================================================

============================================================
2. Formal Interview Summary (for hiring committee)
The candidate described a situation where they disagreed with their manager regarding the technology stack for a new feature. They took the initiative to prepare a detailed analysis comparing the two options and communicated their concerns respectfully in a one-on-one meeting. As a result of their efforts, the team adopted a hybrid approach that combined both suggestions, leading to a more robust solution. While the candidate demonstrated good communication and preparation skills, the overall impact of their actions was limited to a single project, which does not fully meet the expectations for ownership at this level.

============================================================
3. Strengths (Interviewer perspective)
- Clear communication of concerns
- Structured approach to problem-solving (prepared analysis)
- Respectful engagement with manager
- Initiative in suggesting alternatives

============================================================
4. Areas for Improvement
- Need to demonstrate broader impact beyond a single project
- More emphasis on data-driven decision-making in analysis
- Could improve on showcasing personal ownership in the outcome

============================================================
5. Competency Ratings (use FAANG rubric)
- Ownership: Below(🤔)
- Problem Solving: Meets(👌)
- Execution: Meets(👌)
- Collaboration: Meets+(👍)
- Communication: Strong(🌟)
- Leadership / Influence: Below(🤔)
- Culture Fit: Meets(👌)

============================================================
6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 🤔 Leaning No Hire

The candidate showed strong communication and problem-solving skills, but their example lacked sufficient scope and impact, particularly in ownership and leadership. The limited context of a single project does not align with the expectations for a Junior-Mid level candidate in a competitive hiring environment.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide specific metrics or outcomes that resulted from the hybrid approach you implemented?
2. How did you ensure that your analysis was data-driven? What specific data points did you consider?
3. In what ways did you follow up with your manager after the decision was made to ensure the success of the adopted approach?
4. Can you describe a situation where you took ownership of a project from start to finish? What was the outcome?
5. How would you handle a similar disagreement in the future? What would you do differently based on this experience?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "executor-style contribution" (the candidate's role in the final decision appears limited)
  - "lack of reflection" (no clear metrics or data-driven reasoning provided for the technology choice)

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "executor-style contribution" ★★☆☆☆
- "lack of reflection" ★★☆☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's involvement in the decision-making process seems limited, indicating a lack of ownership.
- There is no quantitative data or metrics to support the choice of technology stacks, which is critical for informed decision-making.
- The example does not clearly demonstrate a significant impact on the project beyond immediate tasks.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Provide specific metrics or data to support the technology choice and its long-term benefits.
- Clarify the candidate's direct contributions to the final decision to demonstrate ownership.
- Reflect on the broader impact of the decision on the team or project, beyond personal tasks.
