# Red Flag Evaluation (20251221)

**Rating**: Leaning_No_Hire

## Question

Have you ever been in a situation where another team and yours were creating a similar product? What happened?

## Answer

Situation: At my previous job as a software developer at a tech company, we found ourselves in an unexpected situation where my team and another in-house team were working on projects with overlapping functionalities. Both teams were independently developing tools to automate different parts of the customer service process, but there was significant overlap in the features we were creating.  Task: The task at hand was to address this duplication of effort without hampering the progress and morale of either team.  Action: To resolve this, I suggested a joint meeting between the two teams. During this meeting, we discussed the scope and objectives of both projects in detail. It became clear that while there were similarities, each tool had unique features that were valuable on their own. I proposed a collaborative approach where both teams could work together to integrate the best aspects of each tool into a single, more comprehensive solution. This proposal was well-received, and we formed a joint task force to oversee the integration. I took on the responsibility of coordinating the integration efforts, ensuring that features and code were seamlessly merged while maintaining the integrity and performance of each tool. This required careful planning, constant communication, and several iterations of testing and feedback.  Result: The outcome was a success. The integrated tool was more robust and feature-rich than what either team would have accomplished separately. It was well-received by the end-users, leading to increased efficiency in our customer service processes. This experience taught me valuable lessons in collaboration, communication, and flexibility. It highlighted how breaking down silos and working together towards a common goal can lead to superior results and more efficient use of resources.

## Feedback

============================================================
1. Real-Time Raw Notes (Interviewer's scratch notes)
- Overlapping projects, 2 teams
- Automation tools for customer service
- Joint meeting to discuss scope
- Proposed collaboration, integration
- Coordinated integration efforts
- Successful outcome, robust tool
- Lessons: collaboration, communication, flexibility

============================================================
2. Formal Interview Summary (for hiring committee)
The candidate described a situation where their team and another were developing overlapping customer service automation tools. To address the duplication, they organized a joint meeting to discuss each project's scope and proposed a collaborative integration approach. The candidate coordinated the integration efforts, resulting in a more robust tool that was well-received by end-users. While the candidate demonstrated structured thinking and collaboration, the impact of their individual contributions could be clearer.

============================================================
3. Strengths (Interviewer perspective)
- Clear articulation of the situation and actions taken
- Demonstrated structured thinking in problem-solving
- Effective communication skills in organizing meetings
- Ability to work collaboratively with other teams

============================================================
4. Areas for Improvement
- Need to clarify individual contributions versus team efforts; some ambiguity in ownership
- Lack of quantifiable metrics to demonstrate the impact of the integrated tool
- More emphasis on personal initiative in the integration process

============================================================
5. Competency Ratings (use FAANG rubric)
- Ownership: Meets(👌)
- Problem Solving: Meets+(👍)
- Execution: Meets(👌)
- Collaboration: Strong(🌟)
- Communication: Strong(🌟)
- Leadership / Influence: Meets(👌)
- Culture Fit: Strong(🌟)

============================================================
6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 🤔 Leaning No Hire

The candidate demonstrated solid collaboration and communication skills, but there were ambiguities regarding their individual ownership and impact. The lack of quantifiable results and clarity in personal contributions raises concerns about their readiness for a Junior-Mid level role in a competitive environment.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide specific examples of your contributions during the integration process? What tasks did you lead?
2. How did you measure the success of the integrated tool? Were there any metrics you tracked?
3. What challenges did you face during the integration, and how did you personally address them?
4. Can you describe a time when you had to advocate for your team's approach in the joint meeting? What was the outcome?
5. How did you ensure that both teams felt valued and heard during the collaboration process?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "executor-style contribution" (the candidate primarily describes actions taken by the team rather than their individual contributions)
  - "lack of reflection" (the candidate does not reflect on personal growth or specific lessons learned from the experience)
  - "ambiguity avoidance" (the candidate does not provide specific metrics or data to quantify the success of the integrated tool)

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "executor-style contribution" - ★★★☆☆
- "lack of reflection" - ★★☆☆☆
- "ambiguity avoidance" - ★★★☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's role in the integration process is unclear, suggesting a lack of ownership.
- There is insufficient reflection on personal contributions or lessons learned, limiting insight into growth.
- The absence of quantifiable metrics undermines the impact of the project.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly articulate individual contributions and responsibilities in collaborative projects.
- Include specific metrics or outcomes to quantify the success of projects.
- Reflect on personal growth and lessons learned from experiences to demonstrate self-awareness.
