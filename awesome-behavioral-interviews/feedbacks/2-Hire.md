## Question

Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with your manager.

## Answer

Situation: At my previous job as a software engineer, I once found myself in disagreement with my manager over the approach to a new feature in our software application. My manager wanted to implement the feature using a certain technology stack that I believed was not the best choice for our long-term goals.  Task: My task was to effectively communicate my concerns and suggest an alternative approach that I believed was more beneficial for the project.  Action: I requested a one-on-one meeting with my manager to discuss this issue in detail. Before the meeting, I prepared a comprehensive comparison of the two technology stacks, highlighting aspects like long-term maintainability, performance, compatibility with our existing systems, and overall impact on the project timeline. During the meeting, I presented my findings in a respectful and concise manner, emphasizing my commitment to the project's success and the team's efficiency. I also made it clear that I respected his experience and perspective and was open to further discussion and compromise.  Result: My manager appreciated the thorough analysis and was impressed with the initiative I had taken to research the alternatives. After further discussion and consultation with the team, we decided to adopt a hybrid approach, incorporating elements from both our suggestions. This incident not only led to a more robust solution for our project but also strengthened my relationship with my manager. It taught me the importance of open communication, thorough preparation, and respect for different viewpoints in resolving professional disagreements.

The candidate has demonstrated solid communication and collaboration skills, which are essential for a Junior-Mid level role. However, the lack of quantifiable impact and clarity on ownership slightly lowers the overall impression. They show potential to grow and contribute effectively to the team.

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "executor-style contribution" - The candidate describes actions taken but does not clearly demonstrate ownership of the decision-making process or the final outcome.
  - "lack of reflection" - The candidate does not provide insights into what they learned from the disagreement beyond the general importance of communication.

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "executor-style contribution": ★★★☆☆
- "lack of reflection": ★★☆☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's involvement appears limited to presenting information rather than driving the decision-making process.
- There is insufficient reflection on personal growth or lessons learned from the experience.
- Overall impact on the project is not quantified, which weakens the demonstration of ownership and effectiveness.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly articulate personal contributions and decisions made during the disagreement to demonstrate ownership.
- Include specific metrics or outcomes that resulted from the decision to adopt a hybrid approach.
- Reflect on personal growth or changes in perspective gained from the experience to show deeper learning.
