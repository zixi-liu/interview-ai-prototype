**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with your manager.

## Answer

Situation: At my previous job as a software engineer, I once found myself in disagreement with my manager over the approach to a new feature in our software application. My manager wanted to implement the feature using a certain technology stack that I believed was not the best choice for our long-term goals.  Task: My task was to effectively communicate my concerns and suggest an alternative approach that I believed was more beneficial for the project.  Action: I requested a one-on-one meeting with my manager to discuss this issue in detail. Before the meeting, I prepared a comprehensive comparison of the two technology stacks, highlighting aspects like long-term maintainability, performance, compatibility with our existing systems, and overall impact on the project timeline. During the meeting, I presented my findings in a respectful and concise manner, emphasizing my commitment to the project's success and the team's efficiency. I also made it clear that I respected his experience and perspective and was open to further discussion and compromise.  Result: My manager appreciated the thorough analysis and was impressed with the initiative I had taken to research the alternatives. After further discussion and consultation with the team, we decided to adopt a hybrid approach, incorporating elements from both our suggestions. This incident not only led to a more robust solution for our project but also strengthened my relationship with my manager. It taught me the importance of open communication, thorough preparation, and respect for different viewpoints in resolving professional disagreements.

2. Formal Interview Summary (for hiring committee)
The candidate described a situation where they disagreed with their manager regarding the technology stack for a new feature. They took the initiative to prepare a detailed comparison of the proposed options and requested a one-on-one meeting to discuss their concerns. The result was a hybrid approach that incorporated both perspectives, ultimately benefiting the project. While the candidate demonstrated effective communication and preparation, the scope of their impact appears limited to a single project decision, which may not fully reflect the expectations for a Junior-Mid level.

6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 👍Hire

The candidate shows strong communication and problem-solving skills, which are essential for a Junior-Mid level role. However, the impact of their actions was somewhat limited to a single project, and there is room for improvement in demonstrating broader ownership and data-driven decision-making.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide specific metrics or data that influenced your decision to suggest an alternative technology stack?
2. How did you ensure that your analysis was aligned with the long-term goals of the project and the company?
3. In what ways did you actively contribute to the implementation of the hybrid approach after the meeting?
4. Can you describe a situation where you had to take ownership of a project or task beyond just providing input?
5. How do you typically measure the success of a project or decision you are involved in?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "executor-style contribution" (the candidate's role in the decision-making process appears limited, as the final decision was made collectively with the manager and team)
  - "lack of reflection" (the candidate does not demonstrate personal growth or learning from the disagreement beyond the immediate outcome)

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "executor-style contribution": ★★☆☆☆
- "lack of reflection": ★★☆☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's involvement in the decision-making process lacks clear ownership, as the final decision was a team consensus rather than driven by the candidate.
- There is no indication of personal learning or development from the experience, which is critical for growth in a Junior-Mid level role.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions (very concise)
- Clearly articulate personal contributions and decisions made during the process.
- Reflect on lessons learned and how they can be applied in future situations.
- Provide specific metrics or outcomes that resulted from the decision to strengthen the impact of the example.
