# Red Flag Evaluation (20251221)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Have you ever been in a situation where another team and yours were creating a similar product? What happened?

## Answer

Situation: At my previous job as a software developer at a tech company, we found ourselves in an unexpected situation where my team and another in-house team were working on projects with overlapping functionalities. Both teams were independently developing tools to automate different parts of the customer service process, but there was significant overlap in the features we were creating.  Task: The task at hand was to address this duplication of effort without hampering the progress and morale of either team.  Action: To resolve this, I suggested a joint meeting between the two teams. During this meeting, we discussed the scope and objectives of both projects in detail. It became clear that while there were similarities, each tool had unique features that were valuable on their own. I proposed a collaborative approach where both teams could work together to integrate the best aspects of each tool into a single, more comprehensive solution. This proposal was well-received, and we formed a joint task force to oversee the integration. I took on the responsibility of coordinating the integration efforts, ensuring that features and code were seamlessly merged while maintaining the integrity and performance of each tool. This required careful planning, constant communication, and several iterations of testing and feedback.  Result: The outcome was a success. The integrated tool was more robust and feature-rich than what either team would have accomplished separately. It was well-received by the end-users, leading to increased efficiency in our customer service processes. This experience taught me valuable lessons in collaboration, communication, and flexibility. It highlighted how breaking down silos and working together towards a common goal can lead to superior results and more efficient use of resources.

The candidate demonstrated strong collaboration and communication skills, which are essential for a Junior-Mid level role. However, there is a need for clearer ownership of individual contributions and quantifiable metrics to fully meet the expectations for this level. Overall, they show potential to grow in a team-oriented environment.

7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you specify what your individual contributions were during the integration process? What specific actions did you take?
2. What challenges did you encounter while coordinating the integration, and how did you address them?
3. Can you provide any metrics or data that demonstrate the impact of the integrated tool on customer service efficiency?
4. How did you ensure that both teams remained motivated and engaged throughout the integration process?
5. Were there any disagreements during the collaboration, and how did you handle those situations?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "lack of reflection" (the candidate does not discuss what they learned from the experience beyond general collaboration lessons)
  - "ambiguity avoidance" (the description lacks specific metrics or quantifiable outcomes to support the success claim)
  - "overclaiming contribution" (the candidate's role in the integration process is not clearly delineated from the team effort)

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "lack of reflection": ★★☆☆☆
- "ambiguity avoidance": ★★★☆☆
- "overclaiming contribution": ★★★☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's reflection on personal growth is vague and lacks depth.
- The success of the project is not supported by specific metrics or data.
- The candidate's individual contributions to the project are not clearly articulated, suggesting a potential lack of ownership.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Include specific metrics or outcomes to quantify the success of the integrated tool.
- Provide a clearer description of individual contributions and responsibilities during the integration process.
- Reflect on personal learnings with specific examples to demonstrate growth and insight from the experience.
