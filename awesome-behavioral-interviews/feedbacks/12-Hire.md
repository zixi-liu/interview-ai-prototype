# Red Flag Evaluation (20251221)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a time when you had to prioritize your tasks quickly.

## Answer

Situation: In my previous role as a software developer at a fast-paced tech startup, our team was often juggling multiple projects simultaneously. There was one particular week where the demands peaked unexpectedly.  Task: I was in the middle of developing a new feature for our main product, but at the same time, a critical bug was reported in another project that I had previously worked on. This bug was causing significant issues for one of our key clients. My task was to address both the urgent bug fix and the ongoing development work without compromising the quality and timeline of either.  Action: I quickly assessed the situation and prioritized the tasks. Resolving the critical bug was the immediate priority due to its impact on the client. I communicated this to my team lead and requested a brief pause on the feature development. I then focused on identifying and fixing the bug. After dedicating a few hours to this, I was able to deploy a patch to resolve the issue. Once the urgent matter was handled, I shifted my focus back to the feature development. To manage my time effectively, I broke down the remaining development work into smaller tasks and set specific mini-deadlines. I also stayed a couple of extra hours for the next few days to ensure I was back on track with the feature development.  Result: The quick response to the bug resulted in minimal disruption for the client, who expressed their appreciation for our prompt action. The feature development was also completed on time, meeting the planned release schedule. This experience reinforced my ability to quickly prioritize tasks under pressure, the importance of effective time management, and clear communication with team leads and clients. It was a valuable lesson in balancing urgent and important tasks in a dynamic work environment.
