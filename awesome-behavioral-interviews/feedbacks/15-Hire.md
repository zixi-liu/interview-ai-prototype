# Red Flag Evaluation (20251221)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a time when you missed a deadline. What happened, and how did you handle it?

## Answer

Situation: In my previous role as a software developer at a digital agency, I was working on a critical update for a client's e-commerce website. The update was complex, involving several new features and integrations.  Task: The project had a tight deadline, and it was my responsibility to ensure the timely delivery of the backend components I was working on. The deadline was crucial as it coincided with a major promotional event the client had planned.  Action: As the deadline approached, it became evident that I was going to miss it. Unanticipated technical challenges and integration issues had slowed down the progress significantly. As soon as I realized this, I communicated the situation to my project manager and the client, explaining the reasons for the delay and providing a revised estimate for completion. I also proposed a contingency plan where we would roll out the most critical features first, allowing the client to go ahead with their event, followed by a phased deployment of the remaining features. I increased my work hours and focused intensively on the critical features to meet the new timeline.  Result: The client appreciated the transparency and the proactive approach to managing the situation. The critical features were successfully implemented in time for their event, and the remaining updates were rolled out shortly after. Although missing the original deadline was not ideal, the situation was handled in a way that maintained the client’s trust and avoided major disruptions to their business. This experience taught me valuable lessons about risk assessment, contingency planning, and the importance of clear communication under pressure. It also motivated me to develop better time estimation and project management skills, which have been beneficial in my subsequent projects.
