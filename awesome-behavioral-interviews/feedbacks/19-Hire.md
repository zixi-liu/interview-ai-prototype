# Red Flag Evaluation (20251221)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Describe a time when there was a conflict within your team. How did you help resolve the conflict? Did you do anything to prevent it in the future?

## Answer

Situation: In my previous role as a software developer at a mid-sized tech company, we were working on a significant update for our main product. A conflict arose between two team members, John and Sarah, about the implementation approach for a crucial feature. John wanted to use a more innovative, untested method, while Sarah advocated for a traditional, proven approach. The disagreement escalated, causing a rift in the team and impacting morale.  Task: As a senior member of the team, my task was not only to help resolve the conflict but also to restore team harmony and ensure that such conflicts were minimized in the future.  Action: I first met with John and Sarah individually to understand their perspectives. I listened empathetically to both, acknowledging the merits of their respective views. Then, I organized a team meeting where John and Sarah could present their arguments. The goal was to foster a constructive discussion rather than a debate. During the meeting, I facilitated a calm and objective discussion, ensuring both sides were heard and respected. After much discussion, we collectively decided to prototype both approaches in a controlled environment to objectively assess their viability. To prevent future conflicts, I proposed regular team-building activities and open-forum meetings where team members could discuss their viewpoints and concerns openly before they escalated into conflicts.  Result: The prototyping exercise showed that while John’s method was innovative, it was not stable enough for our current project. We decided to go with Sarah’s approach, but agreed to explore John's method in a future project. This resolution was accepted by both parties, and the team's morale improved significantly. The team-building activities and open forums also proved to be effective in strengthening team cohesion and communication. This experience taught me the importance of effective conflict resolution and proactive communication in maintaining a collaborative and productive team environment.
