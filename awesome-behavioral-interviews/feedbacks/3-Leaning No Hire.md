# Red Flag Evaluation (20251221)

**Rating**: Leaning_No_Hire

## Question

Tell me about a situation when you had a conflict with a teammate.

## Answer

Situation: During a previous role as a software developer, I was part of a team working on a new feature for our company’s main product. A conflict arose with a teammate, let's call her Sarah, who disagreed with my proposed implementation approach, favoring a different, more complex solution.  Task: My task was to resolve this conflict in a way that would not only maintain team harmony but also ensure the best technical solution was chosen for our project.  Action: I initiated a meeting with Sarah to understand her perspective and concerns. I listened attentively to her reasoning and explained my viewpoint and the benefits of my approach, including better maintainability and faster implementation time. Realizing that we were both not fully aligned, I suggested we present both approaches to the team and gather input. During the team meeting, we discussed the pros and cons of each method in detail. I made sure to keep the discussion focused on the technical merits of each approach rather than personal preferences.  Result: The team ultimately decided that a combination of both our approaches was the best way forward. This hybrid solution combined the robustness of Sarah's method with the simplicity of mine. This resolution not only led to the successful completion of the feature but also improved my professional relationship with Sarah. We both appreciated each other's expertise and commitment to the project. This experience taught me the value of collaboration, open communication, and the importance of considering different perspectives in problem-solving.

2. Formal Interview Summary (for hiring committee)
The candidate described a conflict with a teammate regarding the implementation of a new feature. They took the initiative to understand the teammate's perspective and facilitated a team discussion to evaluate both proposed solutions. The outcome was a hybrid approach that combined elements of both solutions, leading to successful feature completion and improved team dynamics. While the candidate demonstrated some effective conflict resolution skills, the impact of their actions was limited to a small team context, which may not fully meet the expectations for ownership and scope at this level.

6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 🤔 Leaning No Hire

The candidate showcased strong collaboration and communication skills but fell short in demonstrating ownership and measurable impact. The example lacked clear metrics and the scope of influence was limited, which raises concerns about their readiness for a Junior-Mid level position in a competitive environment.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide specific metrics or outcomes that resulted from the hybrid solution you implemented?
2. How did you ensure that your proposed solution was the best fit for the project beyond just your personal preference?
3. In future conflicts, how would you take greater ownership of the resolution process to ensure a more impactful outcome?
4. Can you describe a time when you had to influence a decision beyond your immediate team? What was the outcome?
5. How do you plan to apply the lessons learned from this experience in future collaborative projects?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "communication breakdown" (the candidate does not mention any proactive follow-up after the team meeting to ensure alignment)
  - "lack of reflection" (no mention of personal learnings or how this experience influenced future collaboration)
  - "ambiguity avoidance" (the candidate does not clearly define the impact of the hybrid solution on the project or team dynamics)

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "communication breakdown": ★★☆☆☆
- "lack of reflection": ★★☆☆☆
