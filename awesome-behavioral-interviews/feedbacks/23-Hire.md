## Question

How would you design/test a product to make sure its diverse/inclusive to all users?

## Answer

Situation: In my previous role at a software development company, we were creating a new health and fitness app. Early in the design phase, it became apparent that our initial user interface and content did not adequately address the diverse needs and experiences of all potential users, including those with disabilities and from various cultural backgrounds.  Task: My task was to lead the effort in redesigning and testing the app to ensure it was inclusive and accessible to a broad user base, including people with different abilities and from diverse cultural backgrounds.  Action: To address this, I initiated a comprehensive review of our design and development process. I advocated for and implemented the following actions:  User Research: Conducted extensive user research to understand the needs and preferences of a diverse user group. This included surveys, interviews, and focus groups with participants of varied ages, abilities, and cultural backgrounds.  Inclusive Design Principles: Integrated inclusive design principles into our development process. This involved considering factors such as color contrast for visually impaired users, text size options, and culturally sensitive content.  Diverse Testing Team: Assembled a diverse group of beta testers who could provide feedback from different perspectives. This group included people with disabilities, non-native English speakers, and users from various age groups and cultural backgrounds.  Accessibility Standards: Ensured that the app met international accessibility standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).  Regular Feedback Loops: Established regular feedback loops during the development cycle to incorporate user input into the design continually.  Result: The revised app received positive feedback for its inclusivity and user-friendly design. Users particularly appreciated features such as adjustable text sizes, high-contrast color schemes, and culturally diverse content. This approach not only broadened our market reach but also positively impacted our brand image. The project taught me the importance of empathy in design, the value of diverse perspectives in developing products, and the need for ongoing user engagement to create truly inclusive software solutions.

- "overclaiming contribution": ★★★☆☆
- "ambiguity avoidance": ★★★☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate claims leadership without detailing specific contributions, raising concerns about ownership.
- Lacks quantifiable results or metrics to substantiate the positive feedback received, which diminishes credibility.
- Overall impact appears limited to a specific project without broader implications.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly outline specific actions taken by the candidate, differentiating from team efforts.
- Include quantifiable metrics or data to support claims of success and impact.
- Provide examples of how the candidate engaged with diverse user groups beyond general descriptions.
