# Red Flag Evaluation (20251221)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me a time when you had a different opinion than the rest of the team. How did you handle it?

## Answer

Situation: In my previous role as a software developer at a SaaS company, our team was tasked with improving the performance of our main product. After several discussions, the majority of the team was inclined to completely rewrite a significant portion of the legacy code, believing this was the only way to address the performance issues.  Task: Although I understood their reasoning, based on my analysis and experience with the codebase, I believed that a complete rewrite was not only risky but also unnecessary. I thought that targeted optimization and refactoring of specific inefficient code segments would be more efficient and less resource-intensive.  Action: I decided to voice my opinion during a team meeting. To ensure my perspective was considered seriously, I prepared a detailed presentation. This included a performance analysis of the current system, identifying the bottlenecks, and showcasing how targeted refactoring could resolve these issues. I also highlighted the risks associated with a complete rewrite, such as potential new bugs, longer development time, and resource allocation challenges. To demonstrate my point, I took the initiative to refactor a small portion of the code as a proof of concept. I shared the before and after performance metrics with the team, which showed a significant improvement with minimal changes.  Result: After reviewing my analysis and the results of the proof of concept, the team agreed to try the refactoring approach. We were able to significantly improve the system's performance without the high costs and risks of a complete rewrite. The project was completed ahead of schedule and under budget, and the improved performance metrics were well-received by stakeholders. This experience taught me the value of backing up opinions with data and analysis, the importance of effective communication in team settings, and how taking initiative can lead to better decision-making.

7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide specific metrics on the performance improvements achieved through your refactoring? 
2. How did you initially address the team's pushback when presenting your differing opinion?
3. What steps did you take to ensure your proof of concept was aligned with the team's overall goals?
4. Can you elaborate on your role in the project beyond the presentation and proof of concept?
5. How did you handle any resistance from team members after your presentation? 
6. What would you do differently if faced with a similar situation in the future?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "executor-style contribution" - The candidate's actions, while positive, primarily reflect supporting the team's decision rather than leading or owning the direction of the project.
  - "lack of reflection" - The candidate does not demonstrate any personal learning or growth from the situation beyond the immediate technical outcome.

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "executor-style contribution": ★★☆☆☆
- "lack of reflection": ★★☆☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's contribution appears supportive rather than leading, indicating a potential lack of ownership.
- There is insufficient reflection on personal development or lessons learned beyond the technical success.
- Overall impact seems limited to a specific task rather than a broader influence on team dynamics or project direction.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Emphasize personal ownership of outcomes and decisions in future examples.
- Include reflections on how the experience shaped future work or decision-making processes.
- Highlight broader team dynamics and how the candidate influenced or led discussions beyond technical contributions.
