## Question

Assume you are given a task to design a system. How would you do it? How would you resolve ambiguity?

## Answer

When given a task to design a system, my approach involves several key steps to ensure clarity and effectiveness in the design process. Firstly, I start with requirement gathering. This involves discussing with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations from the system. I ask detailed questions to clarify the scope and functionality required. For instance, in a previous project, I prepared a comprehensive list of questions that helped identify specific features and performance criteria expected from the system. After gathering initial requirements, I conduct a feasibility study and research. This helps in understanding the technical aspects, such as the appropriate technology stack, and any constraints or regulatory compliance requirements. Next, I draft an initial design proposal. This typically includes outlining the system architecture, data flow diagrams, and a basic prototype or wireframe of the user interface. This step is crucial for visualizing how different components of the system will interact and function. Resolving ambiguity is a key part of the process. I do this by setting up review meetings with stakeholders where I present my initial design and gather feedback. These discussions are essential for clarifying any vague requirements and aligning the design with the stakeholders' vision. I take detailed notes and make sure to address each point of ambiguity with concrete information or alternatives. Once the design is refined and agreed upon, I create detailed documentation, including technical specifications, user stories, and workflow diagrams. This serves as a guide for the development team and ensures everyone is on the same page. Throughout the process, effective communication, continuous collaboration with stakeholders, and being open to feedback are my top priorities. This approach not only ensures a clear understanding of the project requirements but also facilitates the creation of a system that truly meets the users' needs.

## Feedback

============================================================
1. Real-Time Raw Notes (Interviewer's scratch notes)
- Requirement gathering → stakeholder discussions
- Detailed questions for scope/functional clarity
- Feasibility study → tech stack, constraints
- Initial design proposal → architecture, data flow, wireframes
- Review meetings for feedback → resolving ambiguity
- Documentation for dev team → specs, user stories
- Focus on communication, collaboration, feedback

============================================================
2. Formal Interview Summary (for hiring committee)
The candidate outlined a structured approach to system design, emphasizing requirement gathering through stakeholder discussions and detailed questioning. They demonstrated an understanding of the importance of feasibility studies and initial design proposals, including architecture and wireframes. While they mentioned resolving ambiguity through review meetings and documentation, the candidate's examples lacked specific metrics or quantifiable outcomes, limiting the demonstration of ownership and impact. Overall, the response reflects a solid understanding of the design process but falls short of showcasing clear, individual contributions.

============================================================
3. Strengths (Interviewer perspective)
- Clear structured approach to system design
- Good emphasis on stakeholder communication and collaboration
- Understanding of design documentation importance
- Ability to identify and address ambiguity in requirements

============================================================
4. Areas for Improvement
- Need to provide specific examples of personal contributions and impacts in past projects
- Lack of quantifiable metrics or outcomes to support claims of effectiveness
- Could enhance clarity on how they prioritize conflicting requirements or feedback

============================================================
5. Competency Ratings (use FAANG rubric)
- Ownership: Below(🤔)
- Problem Solving: Meets(👌)
- Execution: Meets(👌)
- Collaboration: Meets+(👍)
- Communication: Meets+(👍)
- Leadership / Influence: Below(🤔)
- Culture Fit: Meets(👌)

============================================================
6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 🤔 Leaning No Hire

The candidate demonstrated a solid understanding of system design processes and collaboration but lacked clear ownership and measurable impact in their examples. The absence of specific contributions and metrics raises concerns about their readiness for a Junior-Mid level role, particularly in a competitive hiring environment.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide a specific example of a project where you took ownership of a particular aspect of the system design? What was your role, and what impact did it have?
2. In your previous projects, how did you measure the success of your design decisions? Can you share any metrics or outcomes?
3. How do you prioritize conflicting feedback from stakeholders during the design process? Can you give an example?
4. Can you describe a time when you faced ambiguity in requirements? What specific steps did you take to resolve it, and what was the outcome?
5. How do you ensure that your documentation is effectively utilized by the development team? Can you provide an example of feedback you received on your documentation?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "executor-style contribution" - The candidate describes processes but lacks clear ownership of specific actions or decisions.
  - "vagueness" - The answer does not provide concrete examples of how ambiguity was resolved or specific metrics used in the design process.

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "executor-style contribution": ★★★☆☆
- "vagueness": ★★☆☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate outlines a structured approach but does not demonstrate clear ownership of the design process.
- Lacks specific examples of metrics or outcomes that validate the effectiveness of their approach.
- Ambiguity resolution is mentioned but not detailed, raising concerns about their ability to navigate unclear requirements.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions (very concise)
- Provide specific examples of past projects where you took ownership of design decisions and their outcomes.
- Include metrics or data that demonstrate the impact of your design choices on project success.
- Clarify how you personally resolved ambiguity in previous projects, with specific instances and actions taken.
