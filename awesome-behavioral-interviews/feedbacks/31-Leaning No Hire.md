## Question

Assume you are given a task to design a system. How would you do it? How would you resolve ambiguity?

## Answer

When given a task to design a system, my approach involves several key steps to ensure clarity and effectiveness in the design process. Firstly, I start with requirement gathering. This involves discussing with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations from the system. I ask detailed questions to clarify the scope and functionality required. For instance, in a previous project, I prepared a comprehensive list of questions that helped identify specific features and performance criteria expected from the system. After gathering initial requirements, I conduct a feasibility study and research. This helps in understanding the technical aspects, such as the appropriate technology stack, and any constraints or regulatory compliance requirements. Next, I draft an initial design proposal. This typically includes outlining the system architecture, data flow diagrams, and a basic prototype or wireframe of the user interface. This step is crucial for visualizing how different components of the system will interact and function. Resolving ambiguity is a key part of the process. I do this by setting up review meetings with stakeholders where I present my initial design and gather feedback. These discussions are essential for clarifying any vague requirements and aligning the design with the stakeholders' vision. I take detailed notes and make sure to address each point of ambiguity with concrete information or alternatives. Once the design is refined and agreed upon, I create detailed documentation, including technical specifications, user stories, and workflow diagrams. This serves as a guide for the development team and ensures everyone is on the same page. Throughout the process, effective communication, continuous collaboration with stakeholders, and being open to feedback are my top priorities. This approach not only ensures a clear understanding of the project requirements but also facilitates the creation of a system that truly meets the users' needs.

## Feedback

============================================================
1. Real-Time Raw Notes (Interviewer's scratch notes)
- Requirement gathering first
- Stakeholder discussions
- Detailed questions for clarity
- Feasibility study, research tech stack
- Initial design proposal: architecture, data flow
- Review meetings for feedback
- Detailed documentation for dev team
- Emphasis on communication, collaboration
- Good structure, but lacks metrics
============================================================

============================================================
2. Formal Interview Summary (for hiring committee)
The candidate outlined a structured approach to system design, starting with requirement gathering and stakeholder discussions. They emphasized the importance of clarifying ambiguities through review meetings and feedback sessions. While the candidate demonstrated a solid understanding of the design process and the need for documentation, they did not provide specific metrics or examples of the impact of their designs. Overall, the response reflects a foundational understanding of the design process but lacks depth in ownership and measurable outcomes.

============================================================
3. Strengths (Interviewer perspective)
- Clear, structured approach to system design
- Effective communication with stakeholders
- Good understanding of requirement gathering
- Focus on documentation and collaboration

============================================================
4. Areas for Improvement
- Provide specific examples or metrics to demonstrate impact of designs
- Clarify personal contributions vs. team efforts in previous projects

============================================================
5. Competency Ratings (use FAANG rubric)
- Ownership: Meets(👌)
- Problem Solving: Meets(👌)
- Execution: Below(🤔)
- Collaboration: Meets(👌)
- Communication: Meets(👌)
- Leadership / Influence: Meets(👌)
- Culture Fit: Meets(👌)

============================================================
6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 🤔 Leaning No Hire

The candidate demonstrates a foundational understanding of system design but lacks specific metrics and clear ownership of outcomes. Given the competitive hiring landscape, the absence of measurable impact and the vague nature of contributions lead to a recommendation of leaning no hire.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide a specific example of a project where your design had a measurable impact? What metrics did you use to evaluate success?
2. In your previous projects, how did you ensure that your contributions were clearly defined and recognized within the team?
3. Can you describe a situation where you faced significant ambiguity in requirements? How did you handle it, and what was the outcome?
4. What specific feedback did you receive from stakeholders during your review meetings, and how did you incorporate that feedback into your design?
5. How do you prioritize features or requirements when gathering information from stakeholders? Can you give an example?
6. Have you ever had to pivot your design based on stakeholder feedback? What was the situation, and how did you manage that change?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "executor-style contribution" - The candidate describes a process but lacks clear ownership of specific outcomes or decisions made during the design process.
  - "vagueness" - The answer does not provide specific metrics or examples of how the design impacted the project or stakeholders.

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "executor-style contribution": ★★★☆☆
- "vagueness": ★★☆☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate outlines a systematic approach but fails to demonstrate clear ownership of the design decisions.
- Lacks specific examples of metrics or outcomes that resulted from the design process.
- Overall, the response is more descriptive than demonstrative of individual impact.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions (very concise)
- Include specific examples of past projects where the candidate took ownership of design decisions and their outcomes.
- Provide quantifiable metrics that demonstrate the impact of the design on stakeholders or project success.
- Clarify individual contributions versus team contributions to highlight personal accountability.
