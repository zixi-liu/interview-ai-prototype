# Red Flag Evaluation (20251221)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision without all the information you needed.

## Answer

Situation: In my last role as a software developer at an e-commerce company, we were in the middle of a critical project to overhaul our online payment system. The deadline was tight due to upcoming regulatory changes. Midway through the project, we encountered a major challenge with one of our payment gateway integrations. The gateway provider was delayed in providing us with the necessary API documentation due to their internal issues.  Task: My task was to ensure the integration was completed on time, despite the lack of complete information from the gateway provider. We needed to move forward but had to do so cautiously to avoid any security or compliance issues.  Action: I first evaluated the partial information we had received to determine what could be reliably inferred about the missing parts. I then consulted with a senior colleague who had previous experience with similar integrations to gather insights based on their past projects. Based on this, I developed a hypothesis about how the missing parts of the API might function. To test this safely, I created a sandbox environment and developed a mock version of the API based on our best guesses. I also reached out to another payment gateway provider we had good relations with, to gain insights into industry-standard practices. Throughout this process, I kept our project manager and the rest of the team informed about the steps I was taking and the risks involved. We agreed to proceed cautiously, with the understanding that we might need to revise our approach once the full information was available.  Result: The mock integration worked well in our tests, and when we finally received the complete API documentation from the original provider, we found that our hypothesis was largely correct. We made some minor adjustments based on the full information and successfully completed the integration on time. This experience taught me the value of resourcefulness and careful risk assessment when making decisions with incomplete information. It also highlighted the importance of collaboration and leveraging available resources to navigate challenging situations.

- Demonstrated structured thinking in evaluating incomplete information
- Resourceful in creating a mock API to mitigate risks
- Effective communication with team and project manager
- Ability to collaborate and seek insights from more experienced colleagues

============================================================
4. Areas for Improvement
- More explicit metrics or data-driven outcomes to quantify success
- Greater emphasis on personal ownership versus team effort in actions taken
- Could enhance decision-making process by detailing how risks were assessed

============================================================
5. Competency Ratings (use FAANG rubric)
- Ownership: 👍
- Problem Solving: 👍
- Execution: 👍
- Collaboration: 🌟
- Communication: 👍
- Leadership / Influence: 👌
- Culture Fit: 👍

============================================================
6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 👍Hire

The candidate demonstrated solid problem-solving skills and effective collaboration, which are essential for a Junior-Mid level role. However, the lack of explicit metrics and a clearer distinction of personal ownership in their actions slightly lowers the overall impact of their response.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide specific metrics or data that demonstrate the success of the mock API integration?
2. How did you ensure that your personal contributions were clear to the team, especially when collaborating with others?
3. Can you elaborate on how you assessed the risks associated with proceeding without complete information?
4. What specific insights did you gain from the senior colleague that influenced your approach?
5. Were there any alternative solutions you considered, and why did you ultimately choose the path you did?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "executor-style contribution" (the candidate relied heavily on a senior colleague for insights, indicating a lack of ownership in decision-making)
  - "vagueness" (the description of the impact of the mock integration lacks specific metrics or quantifiable results)

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "executor-style contribution": ★★★☆☆
- "vagueness": ★★☆☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's reliance on a senior colleague suggests limited ownership in the decision-making process.
- The lack of specific metrics or quantifiable results diminishes the overall impact of the example.
- The response does not clearly demonstrate the candidate's individual contributions or leadership in navigating the situation.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Provide specific metrics or outcomes to demonstrate the impact of decisions made during the project.
- Clarify individual contributions versus team contributions to highlight ownership in problem-solving.
- Include more details on how the candidate's actions directly influenced the project's success or mitigated risks.
