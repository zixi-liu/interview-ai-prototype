# Red Flag Evaluation (20251221)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a situation when you had a conflict with a teammate.

## Answer

Situation: During a previous role as a software developer, I was part of a team working on a new feature for our company’s main product. A conflict arose with a teammate, let's call her Sarah, who disagreed with my proposed implementation approach, favoring a different, more complex solution.  Task: My task was to resolve this conflict in a way that would not only maintain team harmony but also ensure the best technical solution was chosen for our project.  Action: I initiated a meeting with Sarah to understand her perspective and concerns. I listened attentively to her reasoning and explained my viewpoint and the benefits of my approach, including better maintainability and faster implementation time. Realizing that we were both not fully aligned, I suggested we present both approaches to the team and gather input. During the team meeting, we discussed the pros and cons of each method in detail. I made sure to keep the discussion focused on the technical merits of each approach rather than personal preferences.  Result: The team ultimately decided that a combination of both our approaches was the best way forward. This hybrid solution combined the robustness of Sarah's method with the simplicity of mine. This resolution not only led to the successful completion of the feature but also improved my professional relationship with Sarah. We both appreciated each other's expertise and commitment to the project. This experience taught me the value of collaboration, open communication, and the importance of considering different perspectives in problem-solving.

## Feedback

============================================================
1. Real-Time Raw Notes (Interviewer's scratch notes)
- Conflict with teammate (Sarah)
- Disagreement on implementation approach
- Task: resolve conflict, maintain harmony
- Action: meeting with Sarah, listened, explained benefits
- Team discussion on both approaches
- Result: hybrid solution, improved relationship
- Key learnings: collaboration, communication, different perspectives

============================================================
2. Formal Interview Summary (for hiring committee)
The candidate described a conflict with a teammate regarding differing implementation approaches for a software feature. They took the initiative to meet with the teammate to understand her perspective and facilitated a team discussion to evaluate both solutions. The outcome was a hybrid approach that combined elements of both proposals, leading to successful project completion and improved team dynamics. While the candidate demonstrated effective communication and collaboration skills, the impact of their actions on the overall project success was not clearly quantified, which is a consideration for a Junior-Mid level role.

============================================================
3. Strengths (Interviewer perspective)
- Clear articulation of the conflict and resolution process
- Demonstrated ability to listen and incorporate feedback
- Effective facilitation of team discussions
- Maintained focus on technical merits, avoiding personal bias
- Positive outcome in team dynamics and project completion

============================================================
4. Areas for Improvement
- Need to quantify the impact of the hybrid solution on project success
- More clarity on personal contributions versus team efforts
- Could improve on demonstrating ownership of the final decision-making process

============================================================
5. Competency Ratings (use FAANG rubric)
- Ownership: Meets(👌)
- Problem Solving: Meets+(👍)
- Execution: Meets(👌)
- Collaboration: Strong(🌟)
- Communication: Strong(🌟)
- Leadership / Influence: Meets(👌)
- Culture Fit: Strong(🌟)

============================================================
6. Final Overall Recommendation
👍Hire  
The candidate demonstrated solid collaboration and communication skills, effectively resolving a conflict and facilitating a team discussion. However, there is a need for clearer ownership and quantifiable impact on the project, which slightly limits their overall effectiveness at the Junior-Mid level.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide specific metrics or outcomes that resulted from the hybrid solution you implemented? 
2. How did you ensure that your contributions were recognized in the final decision-making process? 
3. Can you describe a situation where you had to take ownership of a project from start to finish? What were the challenges you faced? 
4. In your opinion, what could have been done differently to improve the conflict resolution process? 
5. How do you typically measure the success of a project you are involved in? 
6. Can you give an example of a time when you had to advocate for your solution in a team setting? What was the outcome?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "executor-style contribution" (the candidate primarily facilitated a discussion rather than driving a technical solution independently)
  - "lack of reflection" (no mention of personal learning or growth from the conflict beyond the immediate resolution)
  - "ambiguity avoidance" (the candidate does not provide clear metrics or data-driven reasoning for the chosen solution)

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "executor-style contribution": ★★★☆☆
- "lack of reflection": ★★☆☆☆
- "ambiguity avoidance": ★★★☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate played a facilitative role rather than demonstrating ownership of the technical solution.
- There is insufficient reflection on personal growth or learnings from the experience.
- The absence of clear metrics or data-driven decision-making weakens the impact of the resolution.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly articulate personal contributions and ownership in conflict resolution scenarios.
- Reflect on personal learnings and how they can be applied in future situations.
- Include specific metrics or outcomes that demonstrate the effectiveness of the chosen solution.
