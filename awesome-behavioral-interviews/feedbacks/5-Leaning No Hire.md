**Rating**: Leaning_No_Hire

## Question

Describe a time when you led a team. What was the outcome?

## Answer

Situation: At my previous job in a tech company, I was appointed as the lead developer for a critical project. The project's goal was to develop a new feature for our flagship product that would enable better data analytics capabilities for our clients.  Task: My task was to lead a team of five developers and two UI/UX designers to deliver the project within a six-month timeframe. This involved not only technical leadership but also coordinating with other departments, managing timelines, and ensuring the team remained motivated and productive.  Action: To effectively manage this project, I started by organizing a kickoff meeting to align everyone with the project goals and timelines. I established clear communication channels and regular check-ins to monitor progress. I encouraged open discussions, allowing team members to voice their ideas and concerns, fostering a collaborative environment. Recognizing the strengths of each team member, I delegated tasks accordingly, ensuring an efficient workflow. To maintain morale and manage workloads, I implemented flexible working hours and regular team-building activities. I also liaised with other department heads to ensure our work was in sync with the company's overall objectives and timelines.  Result: The team worked cohesively and efficiently under this structure. We successfully completed the project two weeks ahead of schedule and within budget. The new feature was well-received by clients, leading to a 20% increase in customer satisfaction and a 15% increase in product sales. The project's success also led to my team being recognized by the company’s senior management, and several team members were subsequently promoted. This experience reinforced my skills in leadership, project management, and team collaboration, and it was a significant milestone in my professional development.
