# Red Flag Evaluation (20251221)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

What is something new that you’ve learned recently?

## Answer

Situation: In my role as a software developer at a large tech company, I'm constantly looking for new technologies and methodologies to improve my work and efficiency. Task: Recently, I decided to enhance my understanding of cloud computing, specifically AWS (Amazon Web Services), because our team was transitioning more of our projects to the cloud to leverage its scalability and efficiency. Action: To achieve this, I enrolled in an AWS Certified Solutions Architect course. This comprehensive course covered various aspects of AWS, including EC2, S3, VPC, and Lambda. I dedicated my evenings and weekends to studying and hands-on practice. Not only did I learn about the different services AWS offers, but I also learned how to architect and deploy secure and robust applications on AWS technologies. I focused on practical applications of these services in our current and future projects. Result: As a result of this learning initiative, I passed the certification exam with a high score. More importantly, I was able to immediately apply this knowledge in our team’s projects. For example, I led an initiative to optimize our application deployment using AWS Lambda, which resulted in a 30% reduction in our operational costs and improved scalability. My team and management appreciated this contribution, and it has now become a standard practice in our project deployments. This experience reinforced the importance of continuous learning and staying updated with industry advancements.
