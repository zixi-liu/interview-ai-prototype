# Red Flag Evaluation (20251221)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a time you disagreed with a colleague. How did you handle the situation?

## Answer

Situation: At my previous job as a software developer, we were working on a large-scale web application. A new feature was being implemented, and I had a disagreement with a colleague, whom we'll call Jake, about the best approach to database design for this feature. Jake wanted to use a NoSQL database for greater flexibility, while I believed a relational SQL database was more appropriate due to its strong consistency and established relationships between data entities.  Task: My task was to resolve this disagreement in a way that would lead to the best technical decision for the project and maintain a positive working relationship with Jake.  Action: I proposed that Jake and I have a dedicated meeting to discuss our viewpoints in detail. During the meeting, I listened carefully to Jake’s reasoning and shared my perspective, emphasizing the importance of data integrity and consistency for our application’s requirements. To reach a consensus, I suggested we create a small prototype for each approach, allowing us to assess the pros and cons in a practical context. We also agreed to consult with other team members and gather their insights. This collaborative approach allowed us to evaluate both options objectively.  Result: After testing both prototypes and discussing with the team, we concluded that the SQL approach was more suited to our needs. Jake appreciated the empirical and collaborative manner in which the disagreement was handled. This experience not only led to a technically sound decision for the project but also strengthened the team’s ability to resolve disagreements constructively. It was a valuable lesson in the importance of open communication, collaboration, and evidence-based decision-making in software development.

============================================================

============================================================
2. Formal Interview Summary (for hiring committee)
The candidate described a situation where they disagreed with a colleague on the database design for a web application. They took the initiative to propose a dedicated meeting to discuss their differing viewpoints and emphasized the importance of data integrity. By suggesting the creation of prototypes for both approaches and involving the team for additional insights, they were able to reach a consensus that favored the SQL approach. This collaborative effort not only led to a technically sound decision but also improved their working relationship with the colleague.

============================================================
3. Strengths (Interviewer perspective)
- Clear communication of technical viewpoints
- Structured approach to resolving conflict
- Demonstrated collaboration with team members
- Ability to listen and incorporate feedback
- Focus on data integrity and evidence-based decision-making

============================================================
4. Areas for Improvement
- More explicit metrics or data to support decision-making
- Greater emphasis on personal ownership in the resolution process

============================================================
5. Competency Ratings (use FAANG rubric)
- Ownership: Meets(👌)
- Problem Solving: Meets+(👍)
- Execution: Meets(👌)
- Collaboration: Strong(🌟)
- Communication: Strong(🌟)
- Leadership / Influence: Meets(👌)
- Culture Fit: Strong(🌟)

============================================================
6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 👍Hire

The candidate demonstrated solid collaboration and communication skills, effectively resolving a technical disagreement. However, there is room for improvement in articulating personal ownership and providing data-driven decision-making metrics. Overall, they meet the expectations for a Junior-Mid level candidate.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide specific metrics or data that influenced your decision to prefer SQL over NoSQL?
2. In the meeting with Jake, what specific arguments did you present to advocate for your perspective?
3. How did you ensure that your contributions were recognized in the collaborative process of resolving the disagreement?
4. Can you describe a situation where you had to take ownership of a project or decision that did not go as planned?
5. How do you typically measure the success of the technical decisions made in your projects?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "executor-style contribution" (the candidate primarily describes collaborative actions without clear ownership of the decision-making process)
  - "lack of reflection" (the candidate does not reflect on personal learning or growth from the disagreement)

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- executor-style contribution: ★★★☆☆
- lack of reflection: ★★☆☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's role in resolving the disagreement is described more as a facilitator than a decision-maker, indicating limited ownership.
- There is no explicit reflection on personal growth or lessons learned beyond the technical outcome, which is essential for a Junior-Mid level candidate.
- The example lacks metrics or quantifiable impact, making it difficult to assess the significance of the decision.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly articulate personal contributions and decision-making processes in collaborative situations.
- Include specific metrics or outcomes that demonstrate the impact of decisions made.
- Reflect on personal learnings or skills gained from experiences to show growth and self-awareness.
