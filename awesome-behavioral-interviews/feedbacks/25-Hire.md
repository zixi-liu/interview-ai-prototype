# Red Flag Evaluation (20251221)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a time you disagreed with a colleague. How did you handle the situation?

## Answer

Situation: At my previous job as a software developer, we were working on a large-scale web application. A new feature was being implemented, and I had a disagreement with a colleague, whom we'll call Jake, about the best approach to database design for this feature. Jake wanted to use a NoSQL database for greater flexibility, while I believed a relational SQL database was more appropriate due to its strong consistency and established relationships between data entities.  Task: My task was to resolve this disagreement in a way that would lead to the best technical decision for the project and maintain a positive working relationship with Jake.  Action: I proposed that Jake and I have a dedicated meeting to discuss our viewpoints in detail. During the meeting, I listened carefully to Jake’s reasoning and shared my perspective, emphasizing the importance of data integrity and consistency for our application’s requirements. To reach a consensus, I suggested we create a small prototype for each approach, allowing us to assess the pros and cons in a practical context. We also agreed to consult with other team members and gather their insights. This collaborative approach allowed us to evaluate both options objectively.  Result: After testing both prototypes and discussing with the team, we concluded that the SQL approach was more suited to our needs. Jake appreciated the empirical and collaborative manner in which the disagreement was handled. This experience not only led to a technically sound decision for the project but also strengthened the team’s ability to resolve disagreements constructively. It was a valuable lesson in the importance of open communication, collaboration, and evidence-based decision-making in software development.

## Feedback

============================================================
1. Real-Time Raw Notes (Interviewer's scratch notes)
- Disagreement on DB design (SQL vs NoSQL)
- Importance of data integrity
- Proposed meeting to discuss
- Listening to Jake’s perspective
- Suggested prototypes for both approaches
- Team consultation for insights
- SQL approach chosen after testing
- Positive outcome, strengthened relationship

============================================================
2. Formal Interview Summary (for hiring committee)
The candidate described a situation where they disagreed with a colleague over database design for a web application. They took the initiative to propose a meeting to discuss their differing viewpoints and suggested creating prototypes for both SQL and NoSQL approaches. This collaborative effort led to a decision favoring the SQL approach, which was deemed more suitable for the project's requirements. The candidate effectively demonstrated structured thinking and communication skills, resulting in a positive outcome and improved team dynamics.

============================================================
3. Strengths (Interviewer perspective)
- Clear communication of technical perspectives
- Structured approach to resolving conflicts
- Willingness to collaborate and seek team input
- Ability to listen and incorporate feedback
- Focus on data integrity and project requirements

============================================================
4. Areas for Improvement
- Provide more specific metrics or outcomes from the prototypes to quantify impact.
- Clarify personal contributions versus team efforts to highlight individual ownership.

============================================================
5. Competency Ratings (use FAANG rubric)
- Ownership: Meets(👌)
- Problem Solving: Meets+(👍)
- Execution: Meets(👌)
- Collaboration: Strong(🌟)
- Communication: Strong(🌟)
- Leadership / Influence: Meets(👌)
- Culture Fit: Strong(🌟)

============================================================
6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 👍Hire

The candidate demonstrated solid collaboration and communication skills, effectively managing a disagreement and leading a constructive resolution. However, there is room for improvement in quantifying the impact of their actions and clarifying their individual contributions, which slightly lowers the overall impression of ownership.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide specific metrics or outcomes from the prototypes you created? How did you measure their effectiveness?
2. What was your individual contribution to the prototypes, and how did you ensure your perspective was represented in the final decision?
3. How did you handle any pushback from Jake or other team members during the discussion? Can you give an example?
4. In retrospect, would you approach the disagreement differently? Why or why not?
5. How do you typically ensure that your technical decisions align with project requirements? Can you share an example?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "executor-style contribution" (the candidate primarily describes collaboration without clear ownership of the decision-making process)
  - "lack of reflection" (the candidate does not reflect on what they learned from the disagreement or how they might handle similar situations in the future)

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "executor-style contribution": ★★★☆☆
- "lack of reflection": ★★☆☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's role in the resolution process is unclear, suggesting a lack of ownership.
- The response lacks personal reflection on lessons learned or future application of this experience.
- The example does not demonstrate a significant impact on the project or team beyond the immediate disagreement.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly articulate personal contributions and decision-making in collaborative situations.
- Include reflections on lessons learned and how they would apply them in future scenarios.
- Provide specific metrics or outcomes from the prototypes to demonstrate data-driven decision-making.
