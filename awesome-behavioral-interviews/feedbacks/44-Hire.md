## Question

Describe a time when you had to work simultaneously on both high-priority urgent projects as well as long-term projects. How did you go about handling both?

## Answer

Situation: At my previous job as a software developer, there was a period when our team was tasked with handling an urgent client issue on a live product while also working on a long-term, strategic software development project. Task: My responsibility was to contribute significantly to the urgent client issue resolution without derailing the progress of the long-term project, which I was leading. Action: To effectively manage my time and responsibilities, I first assessed the scope and urgency of the tasks in the immediate project and the long-term project. I organized my tasks by priority and deadlines, using tools like a Gantt chart for the long-term project and a Kanban board for the urgent issue. I delegated some of the less critical tasks of the long-term project to trusted team members, after ensuring they were fully briefed and had the necessary resources. For the urgent project, I established a daily quick stand-up meeting with the team to ensure we were on track and to address any blockers immediately. I also set aside specific hours in my day dedicated solely to the long-term project to ensure continuous progress. Result: This approach allowed me to successfully contribute to resolving the client issue within a week, which greatly enhanced our client relationship and trust in our services. Simultaneously, the long-term project stayed on track due to effective delegation and time management. Balancing these projects taught me valuable lessons in prioritization, delegation, and the importance of agile response in project management. It also highlighted the significance of clear communication with both my team and stakeholders to manage expectations effectively.
