## Question

Tell me about a time when you had a hard time working with someone in your team. How did you handle it?

## Answer

Situation: In my previous role as a software engineer, I was part of a team developing a new mobile application. One of our team members, John, had a very different working style from the rest of the team. While John was highly skilled, he often worked in isolation, which led to misalignment with the team's progress and objectives. Task: My primary responsibility was to ensure the project's success while fostering a collaborative and cohesive team environment. I recognized the importance of addressing this issue proactively to maintain team morale and productivity. Action: I took the initiative to schedule a one-on-one meeting with John to understand his perspective and work habits. During our conversation, I clearly articulated the team's goals and emphasized how each member's contributions were vital. I provided constructive feedback on how his isolated working style was affecting team dynamics and project progress. To bridge the gap, I proposed structured check-ins that respected his work preferences, making them shorter and more focused to minimize disruption. Additionally, I organized work-related team-building activities, such as pair programming sessions, to enhance collaboration. I also documented our approach and outcomes in our team retrospectives and presented the improvements in a company-wide meeting. Result: As a result of these efforts, John appreciated the open communication and was willing to adapt his working style for the benefit of the team. Over two months, team satisfaction scores improved from 3.1 to 4.4 out of 5, and the number of miscommunications decreased from 3-4 per week to about 1 per week. Code review turnaround time improved significantly due to John's increased responsiveness, and our project velocity increased from completing 8 story points per sprint to 12 story points per sprint. Client feedback specifically highlighted our improved team coordination. This experience taught me valuable lessons about the importance of empathy, clear communication, and the need for measurable outcomes in team management. I learned to adapt my communication style to better connect with team members, ensuring that I framed discussions in terms of data and metrics rather than emotional appeals, which ultimately led to more effective collaboration.

## Answer

Situation: In my previous role as a software engineer, I was part of a team developing a new mobile application. One of our team members, let's call him John, had a very different working style from the rest of the team. John was highly skilled but often worked in isolation, which sometimes led to misalignment with the team's progress and objectives. Task: My task was not only to ensure the project's success but also to foster a collaborative and cohesive team environment. It was essential to address the issue without causing any interpersonal conflict or negatively impacting the team's morale. Action: I initiated a one-on-one meeting with John to understand his perspective and work habits. During our conversation, I emphasized the team's goals and how each member's contributions were critical. I also shared feedback about how his working style was impacting the team dynamics and project progress. To bridge the gap, I proposed more frequent check-ins and collaborative sessions, ensuring they were structured to respect his work preferences as much as possible. Additionally, I arranged a few team-building activities to enhance mutual understanding and camaraderie among all team members. Result: John appreciated the open communication and was willing to adapt his working style for the benefit of the team. The increased interaction and understanding among team members led to a more synchronized workflow. The project was completed successfully, with the client praising not only our work but also our team dynamics. This experience taught me valuable lessons in handling diverse work styles and the importance of empathy and clear communication in team management.
