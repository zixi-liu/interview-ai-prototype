# Red Flag Evaluation (20251225)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a complex technical project you've worked on.

## Answer

In my previous role as a backend development lead at a data analytics company, I took complete ownership of a complex project to develop a large-scale data processing and analysis platform capable of handling terabytes of data from various sources while delivering real-time analytics. I began by aligning the project with our strategic business objectives, which allowed me to define a clear and actionable project scope.

I personally designed the overall microservices architecture and wrote the core data processing pipeline, comprising about 3,500 lines of Scala code. After thoroughly evaluating potential technologies, I chose Apache Spark for its unmatched efficiency in processing large datasets. This decision was pivotal, contributing to a 30% increase in processing efficiency. I tracked key metrics such as data processing throughput, achieving a target of 10TB/hour and exceeding it at 15TB/hour, while maintaining a p95 latency of under 2 seconds and an error rate kept under 0.1%. These metrics informed my decisions throughout the project, such as optimizing the data serialization format when latency increased and adding robust error handling when error rates rose under load.

A significant challenge we faced was that our initial data processing approach couldn't handle the volume, taking 8 hours to process what should take 1 hour. I identified the bottleneck in how we were joining data from different sources and implemented a more efficient join algorithm along with in-memory caching for frequently accessed data, which reduced processing time by 85%. Additionally, I addressed the unreliability of one of our data sources by implementing a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff and a fallback data source. I also tackled memory issues when processing large datasets by transitioning to streaming processing instead of loading everything into memory.

To uphold the highest quality standards, I instituted rigorous code review and automated testing protocols, which led to a 30% reduction in bugs before launch. I conducted extensive load testing early and often, testing each component as I built it, and created comprehensive documentation. I held architecture review sessions with the team to ensure alignment and clarity, fostering a collaborative environment where I encouraged open discussions about technical decisions. For instance, when advocating for the use of Apache Spark over a custom solution proposed by another team member, I presented a detailed comparison highlighting that Spark would be faster to implement, more maintainable, and better suited for our needs. This data-driven approach led the team to agree on using Spark, resulting in a successful launch where the platform processed data 50% faster than anticipated.

The project culminated in a successful launch, with our efforts leading to a 30% increase in client satisfaction scores and a 15% growth in our company’s revenue in the subsequent quarter. Throughout this experience, I learned invaluable lessons about thoughtful architecture, proactive problem-solving, and the importance of cross-functional teamwork. This project reinforced my commitment to ownership and leadership, as I navigated complex technical challenges and drove the project to success while ensuring alignment with both business objectives and user needs. Moving forward, I am dedicated to applying these lessons learned to enhance my contributions in future projects, ensuring that I continue to drive impactful results and foster a culture of continuous improvement.
