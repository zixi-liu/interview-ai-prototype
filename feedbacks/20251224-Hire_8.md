## Question

Tell me a time when you linked two or more problems together and identified an underlying issue.

## Answer

In my previous role as a software developer at a healthcare technology company, we faced recurring issues with our patient data management system, specifically intermittent errors in patient data synchronization and occasional system slowdowns during data retrieval. I took ownership of investigating and resolving these issues, believing they were interconnected and indicative of a deeper problem within the system. 

To tackle this, I independently analyzed the system logs and error patterns, writing scripts to correlate the timing of errors and slowdowns. I discovered that the synchronization errors and slowdowns occurred simultaneously, which led me to hypothesize a connection between them. I then collaborated with the database team to review the queries I identified and worked with the operations team to understand the system behavior during peak times. I would estimate that I conducted about 70% of the investigation independently, with the remaining 30% involving collaboration.

Through my thorough review of the database operations, I pinpointed an inefficient database query that was causing system lock-ups, which not only slowed down data retrieval but also disrupted the synchronization process. After implementing a fix that involved a database schema change, I tracked several key metrics over two months to measure the impact: the synchronization error rate dropped from 8% to 0.2%, data retrieval time improved from an average of 3.5 seconds to 0.8 seconds, system uptime increased from 94% to 99.5%, and user-reported slowdowns decreased from 15-20 per week to just 1-2. Additionally, the problematic query's performance improved from taking 4 seconds to just 0.3 seconds.

To communicate my findings and proposed solution, I created a detailed report that included my correlation analysis and root cause identification, which I presented in a team meeting using visualizations. The team appreciated my data-driven approach and the thoroughness of my analysis, and management was pleased with the significant improvement in system reliability.

While implementing the fix, I faced challenges, particularly regarding the database schema change, which required coordination with the database team and a maintenance window. Some team members expressed concerns about the risks involved. I addressed this by developing a detailed rollback plan and thoroughly testing the fix in a staging environment before deployment during a low-traffic period, which helped alleviate concerns.

This experience taught me the importance of looking for patterns and correlations when multiple issues arise, emphasizing the need to find root causes rather than simply treating symptoms. I now prioritize using data and metrics to guide my investigations and ensure that I document the process for future reference. Overall, this experience reinforced my belief in the value of a holistic approach to problem-solving in software development, and I am committed to applying these lessons in my future work.

## Question

Tell me a time when you linked two or more problems together and identified an underlying issue.

## Answer

Situation: In my previous role as a software developer at a healthcare technology company, we were experiencing recurring issues with our patient data management system. Two main problems kept surfacing: first, there were intermittent errors in patient data synchronization across different modules, and second, users reported occasional system slowdowns, particularly during data retrieval processes.  Task: My task was to investigate and resolve these issues. While they initially appeared to be separate problems, I had a hunch that they might be interconnected and symptomatic of a deeper, underlying issue within the system.  Action: To investigate, I started by reviewing the system logs and analyzing the error patterns. I noticed that the synchronization errors and system slowdowns occurred around the same times. This led me to hypothesize that the problems might be related to the way data was being handled and stored. Diving deeper, I performed a thorough review of the database operations, particularly focusing on the processes that ran during data synchronization and retrieval. I discovered that an inefficient database query was causing a lock-up in the system, which not only slowed down data retrieval but also intermittently disrupted the synchronization process. Result: After deploying the fix, we observed a significant improvement in system performance. The synchronization errors ceased, and the system's overall speed and reliability increased. By linking the two problems together and identifying the root cause, I was able to devise a solution that not only resolved the immediate issues but also improved the system’s long-term efficiency. This experience reinforced the importance of looking beyond symptoms to find the root cause of problems and the value of a holistic approach to problem-solving in software development.
