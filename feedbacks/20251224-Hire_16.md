## Question

Tell me about a project that didn’t go according to plan.

## Answer

In my previous role as a software developer at a tech company, I led the backend development team on a project to develop a new customer relationship management (CRM) system aimed at streamlining our sales process and enhancing customer interactions. My responsibility was to ensure seamless integration between our backend components, the front-end system, and the database. During the agile development cycle, we faced significant challenges that caused the project to fall behind schedule. Our sprint velocity dropped from 15 story points to 8, and we were completing only 60% of our planned work, with 12 integration blockers causing delays. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, I took ownership by conducting a thorough analysis of our project plan and metrics, which revealed we were on track to be four weeks behind schedule, potentially extending to eight weeks without intervention.

I organized a series of meetings with my team, the front-end team, and key stakeholders, where I presented detailed analysis documents and visual diagrams comparing our current architecture to the proposed changes. I ensured my voice was heard by speaking up early, clearly articulating the bottlenecks, and advocating for a revised strategy that included shifting our technology stack. I based this decision on a comparison matrix that evaluated performance requirements, team expertise, integration complexity, and long-term maintainability. I also conducted a small proof-of-concept to validate that the new stack would meet our needs more effectively.

To address concerns from team members about the learning curve associated with the new stack, I organized training sessions and provided resources to facilitate the transition. For stakeholders worried about project delays, I transparently communicated that without these changes, the delays would worsen and emphasized that the new approach would ultimately yield a superior product. 

I implemented a comprehensive communication plan that included a detailed document outlining the changes and their rationale, presentations in team meetings, a shared project board with updated timelines, and weekly sync meetings to keep everyone aligned. This proactive approach to communication ensured that all teams were informed and engaged throughout the process.

As a result of these strategic pivots, we successfully delivered a robust CRM system that enhanced our sales team's efficiency by 25%. This experience taught me invaluable lessons in project management, the importance of data-driven decision-making, and the necessity of clear, proactive communication with all stakeholders.

Tell me about a project that didn’t go according to plan.

## Answer

Situation: In my previous role as a software developer at a tech company, we embarked on a project to develop a new customer relationship management (CRM) system. The goal was to streamline our sales process and improve customer interactions.  Task: My responsibility was to lead the backend development team and ensure our components integrated seamlessly with the front-end system and the database.  Action: We followed an agile methodology and had regular sprints. However, partway through the development cycle, we encountered significant issues. The project was falling behind schedule due to unexpected technical challenges and integration problems with third-party services. Realizing the gravity of the situation, I took the initiative to re-evaluate our project plan. I organized a series of meetings with my team, the front-end team, and stakeholders to reassess our approach. We identified key bottlenecks and realized that our initial technical assessment underestimated the complexity of integrating various APIs. I advocated for a revised plan that included a shift in technology stack for certain components and allocated additional resources to tackle the integration challenges.  Result: This strategic pivot was a turning point. Although the project was initially delayed, the new approach allowed us to overcome the technical hurdles and deliver a more robust CRM system. In the end, the project was considered a success, with the CRM system enhancing our sales team's efficiency by 25%. The experience taught me valuable lessons in project management, the importance of agility in problem-solving, and proactive communication with all stakeholders.
