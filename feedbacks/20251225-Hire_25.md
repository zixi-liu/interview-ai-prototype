## Question

Tell me about a time when you had a hard time working with someone in your team. How did you handle it?

## Answer

In my previous role as a software engineer, I led a cross-functional team tasked with developing a new mobile application under a stringent deadline. Early in the project, I identified that one of my team members, John, had a working style that often created misalignment with our project objectives, which posed a significant risk to our timeline and overall success. Taking full ownership of the situation, I prioritized addressing this challenge to ensure we stayed on track.

I scheduled a one-on-one meeting with John to understand his perspective and working habits better. During our conversation, I clearly articulated our shared objectives and the importance of alignment for achieving our goals. I tailored my communication style to resonate with him, providing constructive feedback on how his isolated approach was affecting both his productivity and the team's dynamics. To facilitate better collaboration, I proposed structured weekly check-ins that aligned with his preferred working style, ensuring they were shorter and more focused to address his concerns about disruption. This approach fostered accountability and focus.

Additionally, I initiated team-building activities aimed at enhancing trust and communication among all team members. I made these sessions relevant to our work, such as pair programming, which helped demonstrate the value of collaboration. As a result of these initiatives, we achieved a 40% increase in our collaborative output, measured by the number of completed tasks in our project management tool. Specifically, our project velocity improved from completing 8 story points per sprint to 12 story points per sprint. We completed the project two weeks ahead of schedule, which directly contributed to a 15% increase in client satisfaction ratings, as evidenced by their feedback praising both the quality of the application and the improved team coordination.

I tracked several metrics to assess the effectiveness of my interventions: team satisfaction scores improved from 3.1 to 4.4 out of 5 over two months, and the number of miscommunications decreased from about 3-4 per week to maybe 1 per week. I documented my approach and the outcomes in our team retrospective, which my manager reviewed. I made sure to give credit to John for being willing to adapt, which helped with recognition and reinforced a culture of collaboration.

This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of empathy and proactive communication in leadership. By decisively owning the situation and implementing these changes, I ensured that our project not only met but exceeded expectations. I also recognized areas for my own growth, such as the need to continuously assess team dynamics and adapt my leadership approach. Moving forward, I plan to set clearer metrics from the start and document my interventions systematically, involving the team in designing solutions. This experience has equipped me with the skills to navigate complex team dynamics and drive successful project outcomes, aligning closely with the values and expectations of a senior role in a FAANG company.
