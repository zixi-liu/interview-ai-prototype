## Question

Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision without all the information you needed.

## Answer

In my previous role as a Senior Software Engineer at an e-commerce company, I took full ownership of a critical initiative to overhaul our online payment system in response to impending regulatory changes, which required compliance by a strict deadline. When our payment gateway provider delayed the delivery of essential API documentation, I immediately recognized the risks this posed to our timeline and proactively devised a strategic plan to mitigate these challenges. I made the decisive choice to proceed with developing a mock integration rather than waiting for the documentation, which saved us approximately two weeks—crucial time for meeting our regulatory deadline.

I conducted a thorough analysis of the partial information available, pinpointing specific gaps and making informed assumptions about the missing API components. I documented my decision-making process, including the assumptions I made and the risks I identified, which helped clarify my thought process for the team. To enhance our approach, I consulted a senior colleague with extensive experience in similar integrations, preparing specific questions to maximize our focused 30-minute session. This preparation not only respected their time but also allowed me to gain valuable insights that shaped our strategy.

I independently hypothesized the functionality of the missing API elements and developed a robust mock version in a sandbox environment. This mock integration underwent rigorous testing, where I tracked several metrics: achieving 95% test coverage, an average response time of 180ms, an error rate of less than 0.1%, and compatibility with 92% of the actual API when we received the real documentation. These metrics validated our approach and gave the team the confidence to proceed.

Additionally, I reached out to another payment gateway provider to benchmark our integration strategy against industry best practices. This collaboration enriched our approach and ensured that we adhered to the highest standards of reliability and security. Throughout this process, I maintained clear and transparent communication with our project manager and the entire team, providing regular updates on our progress and the potential risks we were navigating.

When we finally received the complete API documentation from our original provider, I was pleased to find that our hypotheses were largely accurate, requiring only minor adjustments to finalize the integration. This proactive and strategic approach allowed us to meet our compliance deadline, resulting in a remarkable 30% improvement in transaction processing speed and a 40% reduction in payment-related errors, significantly enhancing the overall security and reliability of our payment system.

This experience not only reinforced my commitment to ownership and resourcefulness but also highlighted my ability to lead cross-functional teams through uncertainty and drive successful outcomes under pressure. I learned the importance of decisive action, the value of thorough documentation, and the need for persistence in gathering information. I am confident that these skills will enable me to contribute positively to any team I join, ensuring we not only meet but exceed our goals.

## Feedback

============================================================
1. Real-Time Raw Notes (Interviewer's scratch notes)
- Senior Software Engineer, e-commerce
- Overhaul payment system for compliance
- Delayed API docs → risk to timeline
- Analyzed partial info, made assumptions
- Consulted senior colleague for insights
- Developed mock API, 95% success in tests
- Reached out to another provider for benchmarking
- Clear communication with team, updates on risks
- Final API docs mostly accurate, minor adjustments
- 30% improvement in processing speed, 40% reduction in errors
- Ownership, resourcefulness, cross-functional leadership

============================================================
2. Formal Interview Summary (for hiring committee)
The candidate described a situation where they led the overhaul of an online payment system under a tight deadline due to regulatory changes. Faced with delayed API documentation, they analyzed available information, consulted a senior colleague, and created a mock integration that achieved a 95% success rate. They benchmarked against another provider, maintained clear communication with the team, and ultimately met the compliance deadline with significant improvements in transaction processing speed and error reduction. While the candidate demonstrated structured thinking and initiative, the scope of ownership and impact could be more clearly defined.

============================================================
3. Strengths (Interviewer perspective)
- Demonstrated structured thinking in analyzing incomplete information
- Proactive approach to problem-solving and risk mitigation
- Effective communication with team and stakeholders
- Ability to leverage team expertise for better outcomes
- Achieved measurable improvements in system performance

============================================================
4. Areas for Improvement
- Clarify personal ownership versus team contributions; some actions felt more collaborative than individually driven.
- Provide more specific metrics or data to support claims of success and impact; some results were vague.
- Explore deeper decision-making processes when faced with uncertainty; more insight into assumptions made would strengthen the response.

============================================================
5. Competency Ratings (use FAANG rubric)
- Ownership: Meets(👌)
