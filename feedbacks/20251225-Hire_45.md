**Rating**: Hire

## Question

How would you design/test a product to make sure its diverse/inclusive to all users?

## Answer

In my previous role as the lead engineer for a health and fitness app, I took full ownership of a comprehensive redesign initiative aimed at enhancing inclusivity and accessibility for our diverse user base. Understanding the critical need for an app that resonates with various demographics, I initiated a robust user research program that included conducting over 200 surveys, 15 in-depth interviews, and three focus groups specifically targeting individuals with disabilities and non-native English speakers. This effort led to the identification of key pain points, such as navigation difficulties and the lack of culturally relevant content, which I prioritized for immediate resolution.

To address these challenges, I personally led the implementation of inclusive design principles throughout the development lifecycle. I wrote approximately 800 lines of code for key features, including adjustable text sizes and high-contrast color schemes, ensuring compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). I also created the accessibility testing scripts and conducted audits against the WCAG compliance checklist. By strategically prioritizing features that maximized user experience while aligning with our technical capabilities and development timelines, we achieved a 35% increase in users from underrepresented groups and improved our app store rating from 3.4 to 4.6 stars.

To validate our design choices, I established and led a diverse beta testing group of 30 individuals, conducting bi-weekly feedback sessions that I facilitated. I actively engaged with participants, fostering an environment of open dialogue to gather their insights. This iterative feedback process was crucial; I meticulously analyzed their responses, which directly informed a significant redesign of our navigation structure. As a result of my leadership, we achieved a 50% reduction in user-reported navigation issues and a 40% increase in overall usability ratings across all demographics. Notably, task completion rates improved by 28% overall and by 42% for users with disabilities.

The impact of my leadership in this initiative was substantial. We recorded a 40% increase in user satisfaction ratings and a 30% boost in downloads within the first month of launch, significantly broadening our market reach and enhancing our brand image. Throughout the project, I faced challenges in gaining buy-in from the product team, who were concerned about the timeline impact and cost of implementing inclusive design. I addressed this by presenting data from other companies demonstrating that inclusive design improves overall product quality and by creating a phased approach to implement high-impact, low-effort changes first, which showcased quick wins.

This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of empathy in design and the value of diverse perspectives in creating products that serve all users. I am committed to fostering an inclusive culture in every team I join, leveraging my proactive leadership and collaboration skills to drive measurable outcomes. My focus on clear ownership and accountability, coupled with a data-driven approach to decision-making, ensures that I contribute effectively to both team success and organizational goals. I have learned that true leadership involves not only guiding a team but also embracing feedback and continuously evolving to meet the needs of all users, which I will carry forward into future projects.
