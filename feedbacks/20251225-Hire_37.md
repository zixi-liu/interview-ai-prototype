**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Assume you are given a task to design a system. How would you do it? How would you resolve ambiguity?

## Answer

When I am tasked with designing a system, I take a comprehensive and strategic approach that emphasizes clear ownership, robust problem-solving, and measurable outcomes. I begin by conducting in-depth stakeholder interviews and workshops to gather insights and ensure alignment on project objectives. For instance, in a recent project to overhaul our customer onboarding process, I led workshops that identified 30 critical requirements, directly addressing user pain points and aligning with our strategic goals, which resulted in a 20% increase in customer satisfaction scores, as confirmed by post-onboarding surveys.

After gathering requirements, I took ownership of a detailed feasibility study where I evaluated various technology stacks and compliance considerations. I designed a microservices architecture that allowed us to scale different components independently, which was crucial given our user base growth of 150% over the past year. This architecture choice enabled us to handle 5x more traffic without major infrastructure changes, improving system response time by 40% and reducing deployment time from 2 hours to just 15 minutes. My decision was based on data from previous projects, where similar architectures delivered substantial performance improvements, thereby minimizing risk.

I then developed a comprehensive design proposal that included system architecture diagrams, data flow charts, and user interface wireframes. I organized stakeholder review meetings where I presented the design, actively solicited feedback, and resolved ambiguities through structured discussions. For example, when a stakeholder expressed concerns about the complexity of my initial design, I facilitated a detailed discussion about the trade-offs, advocating for the long-term benefits of scalability while also simplifying certain components to meet their needs. This collaborative approach not only refined our design but also fostered a sense of ownership among team members, resulting in a 25% improvement in user engagement metrics.

Taking full ownership of the project, I created extensive documentation, including technical specifications and user stories, which served as a clear roadmap for the development team. I utilized collaboration tools like Slack and Confluence to ensure transparent communication, keeping all team members aligned and informed throughout the project lifecycle. My leadership was instrumental in cultivating a culture of collaboration; I encouraged team contributions, recognized individual efforts, and facilitated knowledge sharing, which significantly boosted team morale and productivity.

During the project, I encountered challenges such as conflicting stakeholder priorities. To navigate these complexities, I led a prioritization workshop where I created a priority matrix to rank requirements based on user impact and business value. This structured approach enabled us to focus on high-impact features first, ensuring that we delivered value early in the process. As a direct result of my strategic leadership and decisive ownership, we achieved a 30% reduction in onboarding time. By effectively influencing cross-functional teams and ensuring alignment with organizational goals, I delivered a technically robust product that met user needs.

This experience not only underscores my ability to lead impactful initiatives but also reflects my commitment to fostering a collaborative environment, continuous learning, and innovation in system design. I regularly reflect on these experiences to identify areas for personal growth, ensuring that I evolve as a leader and engineer in a fast-paced environment. My proactive approach and focus on measurable outcomes position me as a strong candidate who can drive significant contributions at a senior level within a FAANG organization.

7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide specific metrics or data that directly resulted from your design decisions beyond customer satisfaction?
2. In your experience with conflicting stakeholder priorities, what specific challenges did you face, and how did you personally address them?
3. Can you clarify your individual contributions versus team efforts in the workshops and prioritization sessions you led?
4. How do you measure the success of your designs post-implementation, and what metrics do you track?
5. What specific steps do you take to ensure that your documentation is utilized effectively by the development team?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Overclaiming contribution: The candidate claims significant ownership and impact in a collaborative environment, but lacks specific metrics or evidence to substantiate their individual contributions.
- Ambiguity avoidance: The candidate does not clearly address how they resolved ambiguity beyond facilitating discussions, which may indicate a lack of direct involvement in decision-making.
- Communication breakdown: The answer does not demonstrate effective communication strategies in resolving conflicting stakeholder priorities, relying instead on a workshop format without detailing personal contributions.

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- Overclaiming contribution: ★★★☆☆
- Ambiguity avoidance: ★★☆☆☆
- Communication breakdown: ★★☆☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's claims of ownership and impact are not sufficiently supported by specific metrics or examples of personal contributions.
- There is a lack of clarity in how ambiguity was specifically resolved, which raises concerns about decision-making capabilities.
- The approach to stakeholder conflicts appears to rely on group consensus without demonstrating individual leadership in communication.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Provide specific examples of personal contributions and decisions made during the project to clarify ownership.
- Detail how ambiguity was resolved with concrete actions taken rather than relying on group discussions.
- Include metrics or data that directly link the candidate's actions to project outcomes to strengthen claims of impact.
