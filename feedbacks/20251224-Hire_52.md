## Question

Assume you are given a task to design a system. How would you do it? How would you resolve ambiguity?

## Answer

When given the task to design a system, I take full ownership of the process and focus on delivering measurable results. My approach begins with engaging stakeholders through comprehensive interviews and workshops to gather insights and clarify expectations. For instance, in a recent project aimed at overhauling our customer onboarding process, I led targeted sessions that resulted in over 30 well-defined requirements. This not only ensured alignment with user needs but also supported our strategic business objectives.

After gathering requirements, I conducted a detailed feasibility study, evaluating multiple technology stacks and compliance considerations. I made the strategic decision to implement a microservices architecture, which I projected would reduce deployment times from 2 hours to just 15 minutes and enhance system resilience—critical for accommodating a user base that grew by 150% in the past year. This architecture allowed us to scale different components independently, enabling us to handle 5 times more traffic without major infrastructure changes, with system performance improving by 40% and development velocity increasing as teams could work independently, reducing merge conflicts by 60%.

I developed a comprehensive design proposal that included system architecture diagrams, data flow charts, and user interface wireframes. I organized and led review meetings with stakeholders, actively seeking feedback and presenting alternative solutions to address ambiguities. For example, when a stakeholder expressed concerns about the complexity of my initial design, I facilitated a detailed discussion about the trade-offs, explaining the long-term benefits while also listening to their concerns. We reached a compromise that simplified certain aspects of the design while maintaining scalability for critical components. This collaborative process not only refined our design but also led to a consensus that improved user engagement metrics by 25%.

Taking full ownership of the project, I created detailed documentation, including technical specifications and user stories, which served as a clear roadmap for the development team. I utilized tools like Slack and Confluence to maintain ongoing communication and transparency, ensuring all team members were aligned and informed throughout the project lifecycle. My leadership was pivotal in fostering a culture of collaboration; I encouraged team contributions and recognized individual efforts, which enhanced overall team morale and productivity.

As a result of my proactive approach, we achieved a 30% reduction in onboarding time and a 20% increase in customer satisfaction scores. By decisively owning the design process and effectively influencing cross-functional teams, I ensured that the final product was not only technically sound but also strategically aligned with the organization’s goals. This experience underscores my ability to lead impactful initiatives while promoting a collaborative environment, reflecting my dedication to excellence and innovation in system design. I also learned the importance of being data-driven and facilitating discussions among stakeholders to prioritize requirements effectively, which I will apply to future projects.

## Question

Assume you are given a task to design a system. How would you do it? How would you resolve ambiguity?

## Answer

When given the task to design a system, I approach it with a strong sense of ownership and a commitment to delivering measurable results. My first step is to engage in comprehensive stakeholder interviews and workshops to gather insights and clarify expectations. For example, in a recent project to overhaul our customer onboarding process, I led a series of targeted sessions that resulted in over 30 well-defined requirements. This not only ensured alignment with user needs but also supported our strategic business objectives.

Following the requirement gathering, I conducted a detailed feasibility study, evaluating multiple technology stacks and compliance considerations. Based on data from previous initiatives, I made the strategic decision to implement a microservices architecture, which I projected would reduce deployment times by 40% and enhance system resilience—critical for accommodating a user base that grew by 150% in the past year.

I then developed a comprehensive design proposal, including system architecture diagrams, data flow charts, and user interface wireframes. I organized and led review meetings with stakeholders, where I actively sought feedback and presented alternative solutions to address ambiguities. This collaborative process not only refined our design but also led to a consensus that improved user engagement metrics by 25%.
