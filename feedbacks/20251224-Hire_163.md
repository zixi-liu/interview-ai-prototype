# Red Flag Evaluation (20251224)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Describe a time when there was a conflict within your team. How did you help resolve the conflict? Did you do anything to prevent it in the future?

## Answer

In my previous role as a senior software developer at a mid-sized tech company, I faced a significant conflict between two team members, John and Sarah, regarding the implementation approach for a critical feature in our main product. John proposed an innovative but untested method, while Sarah advocated for a traditional, proven approach. The disagreement escalated, affecting team morale and productivity, which prompted me to take decisive ownership of the situation.

Recognizing the urgency, I scheduled one-on-one meetings with both John and Sarah to understand their perspectives and the rationale behind their approaches. I actively listened, validated their concerns, and fostered an environment of trust. During this process, I ensured both felt equally heard by timing their presentations and asking clarifying questions to each. This approach helped de-escalate tensions and allowed for a balanced discussion.

I then organized a structured team meeting where both members presented their arguments to the entire team. To shift the discussion from a debate to a collaborative problem-solving session, I reframed the question from "which approach is better?" to "what criteria should we use to evaluate both approaches?" This pivotal moment encouraged a more constructive dialogue. I proposed that we prototype both approaches in a controlled environment, which I led. I defined key performance metrics aligned with our team's goals, including stability, scalability, user experience, and team satisfaction. Over three months, team satisfaction survey scores improved from 3.2 to 4.5 out of 5, and the number of conflicts reported in our retrospectives decreased from 2-3 per month to about 1 every two months.

The results of our prototyping revealed that while John’s method had innovative potential, it lacked the stability required for our current project timeline. Ultimately, we decided to implement Sarah’s approach, with a commitment to revisit John’s method in a future project when we could allocate more resources for experimentation. This resolution not only satisfied both parties but also significantly improved team morale, as everyone felt their contributions were valued and recognized.

To prevent similar conflicts in the future, I initiated regular team-building activities and open-forum meetings where team members could express their ideas and concerns. I tracked participation in these meetings, which consistently reached 85-90% of the team, and observed that feedback quality during code reviews became more constructive and less defensive. I presented these metrics to our manager, who was impressed with the improvement.

This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of proactive communication and structured conflict resolution. I learned that intervening earlier could have mitigated the escalation, and I recognized the value of setting clear ground rules for discussions. Moving forward, I am committed to applying these insights to foster a collaborative team culture where diverse perspectives are valued and leveraged for innovation, ultimately driving both team success and project outcomes. My role in this process not only enhanced my leadership skills but also solidified my ability to influence cross-team dynamics, ensuring that we maintain a high-performing and cohesive work environment.
