## Question

Assume you are given a task to design a system. How would you do it? How would you resolve ambiguity?

## Answer

When tasked with designing a system, I adopt a comprehensive and proactive approach that emphasizes clear ownership, effective problem-solving, and measurable outcomes. My first step is to engage with stakeholders through targeted interviews and collaborative workshops to gather insights and align on project objectives. For instance, in a recent initiative to revamp our customer onboarding process, I led a series of workshops that identified 30 critical requirements. This thorough engagement not only clarified project goals but also resulted in a 20% increase in customer satisfaction scores, as indicated by post-onboarding surveys, demonstrating the tangible impact of my leadership.

After gathering requirements, I took full ownership of conducting a detailed feasibility study, meticulously evaluating various technology stacks and compliance considerations. I advocated for a microservices architecture, which allowed us to scale different components independently, projecting a 40% reduction in deployment times and enabling us to handle 5x more traffic without major infrastructure changes. This decision was informed by data from previous projects, where similar architectures yielded substantial performance improvements, thereby minimizing risk and ensuring scalability. I tracked the impact of this architecture by measuring system performance, where response times improved by 40%, and development velocity increased, reducing merge conflicts by 60%.

I then developed a comprehensive design proposal that included system architecture diagrams, data flow charts, and user interface wireframes. I organized and led stakeholder review meetings to present the design, actively soliciting feedback and addressing ambiguities through structured discussions. For example, when a stakeholder expressed concerns that my initial design was too complex, I facilitated a detailed discussion about the trade-offs, ultimately simplifying certain aspects while retaining the scalable architecture for critical components. This compromise resulted in a simpler system that still met our scalability needs, showcasing my flexibility and advocacy for essential design principles.

Taking complete ownership of the project, I created extensive documentation, including technical specifications and user stories, which served as a clear roadmap for the development team. I utilized collaboration tools like Slack and Confluence to ensure transparent communication, keeping all team members aligned and informed throughout the project lifecycle. My leadership was instrumental in cultivating a culture of collaboration; I encouraged team contributions, recognized individual efforts, and facilitated knowledge sharing, significantly boosting team morale and productivity.

During the project, I encountered challenges such as conflicting stakeholder priorities. To navigate these complexities, I created a priority matrix that illustrated the impact versus effort of various requirements and facilitated discussions to rank them based on user impact and business value. This structured approach enabled us to focus on high-impact features first, ensuring that we delivered value early in the process. As a direct result of my strategic leadership and decisive ownership, we achieved a 30% reduction in onboarding time. By effectively influencing cross-functional teams and ensuring alignment with organizational goals, I delivered a technically robust product that met user needs.

This experience underscores my ability to lead impactful initiatives while fostering a collaborative environment and promoting continuous learning and innovation in system design. I regularly reflect on these experiences, identifying actionable insights that drive my growth as a leader and engineer in a fast-paced environment. My proactive approach, focus on measurable outcomes, and commitment to fostering a collaborative culture position me as a strong candidate capable of driving significant contributions at a senior level within a FAANG organization.
