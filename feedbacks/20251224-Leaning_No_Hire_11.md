## Question

What is something new that you’ve learned recently?

## Answer

In my role as a software developer at a large tech company, I recognized the need to enhance my understanding of cloud computing, particularly AWS, as our team was transitioning projects to leverage its scalability and efficiency. To take ownership of this learning opportunity, I enrolled in an AWS Certified Solutions Architect course, dedicating my evenings and weekends to studying and hands-on practice. This course covered critical AWS services such as EC2, S3, VPC, and Lambda, and I focused on how to architect and deploy secure applications using these technologies.

Upon passing the certification exam with a high score, I immediately applied my knowledge by leading an initiative to optimize our application deployment using AWS Lambda. I personally designed the Lambda architecture, wrote approximately 1,200 lines of deployment scripts, and migrated three existing services to Lambda. Additionally, I created infrastructure as code using Terraform, which I had learned during the course, and developed comprehensive documentation and templates for my team to utilize. This initiative resulted in a 30% reduction in operational costs, translating to about $2,000 in monthly savings, and improved response times by 45%. The scalability of our applications increased significantly, allowing us to handle five times more traffic, and deployment times were reduced by 60%.

To ensure my team adopted these new practices, I organized training sessions to teach them about AWS Lambda and best practices, provided detailed documentation, and engaged in pair programming sessions. Initially, some team members were resistant to change, but I addressed their concerns by presenting real data on cost savings and performance improvements, making the transition gradual by migrating services one at a time to build their confidence.

Beyond this optimization initiative, I leveraged my AWS knowledge to assist another team in migrating their application to AWS, sharing best practices and mentoring a junior developer who subsequently achieved certification as well. I also utilized my expertise to enhance our CI/CD pipeline, which improved deployment times by 40%. I tracked several key metrics, including cost reductions, response times, scalability, and deployment efficiency, and communicated these results through a dashboard presented in team meetings. This clear demonstration of value not only facilitated the adoption of AWS practices but also sparked greater interest in cloud technologies among my colleagues.

Throughout this journey, I faced challenges such as understanding the vast array of AWS services and managing costs effectively. I overcame these by focusing on our specific use cases first and learning about cost optimization strategies. Additionally, I tackled advanced concepts like VPC networking through hands-on labs and small projects. This experience reinforced my commitment to continuous learning, problem-solving, and collaboration, ultimately contributing to our team's success and establishing a culture of innovation.

What is something new that you’ve learned recently?

## Answer

Situation: In my role as a software developer at a large tech company, I'm constantly looking for new technologies and methodologies to improve my work and efficiency. Task: Recently, I decided to enhance my understanding of cloud computing, specifically AWS (Amazon Web Services), because our team was transitioning more of our projects to the cloud to leverage its scalability and efficiency. Action: To achieve this, I enrolled in an AWS Certified Solutions Architect course. This comprehensive course covered various aspects of AWS, including EC2, S3, VPC, and Lambda. I dedicated my evenings and weekends to studying and hands-on practice. Not only did I learn about the different services AWS offers, but I also learned how to architect and deploy secure and robust applications on AWS technologies. I focused on practical applications of these services in our current and future projects. Result: As a result of this learning initiative, I passed the certification exam with a high score. More importantly, I was able to immediately apply this knowledge in our team’s projects. For example, I led an initiative to optimize our application deployment using AWS Lambda, which resulted in a 30% reduction in our operational costs and improved scalability. My team and management appreciated this contribution, and it has now become a standard practice in our project deployments. This experience reinforced the importance of continuous learning and staying updated with industry advancements.
