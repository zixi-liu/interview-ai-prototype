## Question

Tell me about a project that didn’t go according to plan.

## Answer

Situation: In my previous role as a software developer at a tech company, we embarked on a project to develop a new customer relationship management (CRM) system aimed at streamlining our sales process and improving customer interactions. Task: As the lead for the backend development team, I was responsible for ensuring our components integrated seamlessly with the front-end system and the database. Action: We adopted an agile methodology with regular sprints, but halfway through the development cycle, we faced significant delays due to unexpected technical challenges and integration issues with third-party services. Recognizing the urgency, I took ownership of the situation by conducting a thorough analysis of our project metrics, which revealed that our sprint velocity had dropped from 15 story points to 8, and we were only completing 60% of our planned work. I organized a series of meetings with my team, the front-end team, and key stakeholders, where I presented detailed analysis documents and visual diagrams comparing our current architecture with the proposed changes. This preparation ensured my voice was heard, and I actively solicited input while making sure my key points were emphasized. We identified that our initial technical assessment had underestimated the complexity of integrating various APIs, leading to 12 integration blockers that were consuming 40% of our development time. I advocated for a revised plan that involved shifting to a new technology stack, which I justified with a comparison matrix highlighting performance requirements, team expertise, integration complexity, and long-term maintainability. I also conducted a proof-of-concept to validate this approach. To address concerns about the learning curve associated with the new stack, I organized training sessions and provided resources for the team. I communicated transparently with stakeholders about the potential delays, demonstrating that without these changes, we could face an 8-week delay. Result: This strategic pivot was a turning point for the project. Although we initially fell behind schedule by 4 weeks, the new approach allowed us to overcome the technical hurdles and ultimately deliver a robust CRM system that enhanced our sales team's efficiency by 25%. The experience taught me invaluable lessons in project management, the importance of data-driven decision-making, and the necessity of proactive communication with all stakeholders.

## Answer

Situation: In my previous role as a software developer at a tech company, we embarked on a project to develop a new customer relationship management (CRM) system. The goal was to streamline our sales process and improve customer interactions.  Task: My responsibility was to lead the backend development team and ensure our components integrated seamlessly with the front-end system and the database.  Action: We followed an agile methodology and had regular sprints. However, partway through the development cycle, we encountered significant issues. The project was falling behind schedule due to unexpected technical challenges and integration problems with third-party services. Realizing the gravity of the situation, I took the initiative to re-evaluate our project plan. I organized a series of meetings with my team, the front-end team, and stakeholders to reassess our approach. We identified key bottlenecks and realized that our initial technical assessment underestimated the complexity of integrating various APIs. I advocated for a revised plan that included a shift in technology stack for certain components and allocated additional resources to tackle the integration challenges.  Result: This strategic pivot was a turning point. Although the project was initially delayed, the new approach allowed us to overcome the technical hurdles and deliver a more robust CRM system. In the end, the project was considered a success, with the CRM system enhancing our sales team's efficiency by 25%. The experience taught me valuable lessons in project management, the importance of agility in problem-solving, and proactive communication with all stakeholders.
