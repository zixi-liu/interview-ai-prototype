# Red Flag Evaluation (20251225)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a project that didn’t go according to plan.

## Answer

In my previous role as the lead software developer at a tech company, I took complete ownership of the backend development for a new customer relationship management (CRM) system aimed at optimizing our sales processes and enhancing customer interactions. I was responsible for the architectural design, implementation, and deployment phases, ensuring seamless integration among backend components, the front-end system, and the database.

During the project, we encountered significant delays due to unforeseen technical challenges with integrating third-party APIs, which we had initially underestimated. To address this, I prepared detailed analysis documents outlining the bottlenecks and proposed solutions, and created visual diagrams comparing the current architecture with the proposed changes. I initiated structured cross-functional meetings with my backend team, front-end developers, and key stakeholders, where I presented my analysis clearly and ensured my key points were heard while also inviting input from others. Following each meeting, I sent written summaries to document our discussions and decisions, reinforcing my contributions and ensuring alignment.

To tackle the integration challenges, I proposed a strategic pivot in our technology stack for certain components, which I based on a comprehensive assessment of our metrics: our sprint velocity had dropped from 15 story points to 8, our completion rate was only 60% of planned work, and we faced 12 integration blockers that consumed 40% of our development time. I quantified the potential delay as 4 weeks behind schedule, which could have escalated to 8 weeks without a change in approach. I presented these metrics to stakeholders, clearly articulating the rationale behind the pivot and the long-term benefits of the new stack, which included better performance, improved API support, and enhanced maintainability.

While we did experience a one-month delay, this strategic pivot led to the delivery of a more robust CRM system that improved our sales team's efficiency by 25% within the first quarter post-deployment. We tracked key performance indicators, including a 30% reduction in time spent on customer interactions and a 20% increase in successful sales conversions, directly correlating these metrics to the changes I implemented. My direct contributions included designing the new architecture, leading the integration efforts, and mentoring junior developers, which were critical in overcoming the technical hurdles we faced.

This experience reinforced my commitment to agile project management, proactive communication, and decisive leadership in overcoming obstacles. I learned the importance of conducting thorough risk assessments, particularly regarding external dependencies. Moving forward, I plan to implement a structured risk assessment framework that includes detailed evaluations of third-party APIs and their potential impact on timelines, supported by a comprehensive communication plan to keep all stakeholders informed and engaged. This will enhance my leadership effectiveness and cultivate an environment where innovation and problem-solving can thrive, ultimately driving better project outcomes.
