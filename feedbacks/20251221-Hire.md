## Question

Tell me about a time you solved a conflict.

## Answer

Sure. One conflict I handled recently was around resource allocation between our Product team and our Infrastructure team. 
Both had high-priority projects, but they were fighting for the same set of engineers, and discussions had completely 
stalled because everyone was arguing based on “what felt fair.”

Since the delay was blocking two critical launches, I stepped in and took ownership of the decision process. 
I spent some time gathering concrete data from both sides—impact projections, engineering estimates, risks, 
dependencies—and built a simple comparison model that laid out the trade-offs under different allocation scenarios.

Instead of having another open-ended debate, I organized a structured decision review. I walked everyone through 
the data, and to avoid the conversation drifting back into opinions, I set a few clear criteria upfront: alignment 
with quarterly goals, risk to customers, and expected business impact. Based on that, I proposed a hybrid plan: give 
Product the resources needed to hit their near-term launch, while still guaranteeing enough support for Infra so 
their core milestone wouldn’t slip by multiple sprints.

With that structure, we were able to reach alignment in under an hour. Product shipped on time and ended up driving 
about a 12% uplift in user activation, and Infrastructure only slipped by one sprint instead of three. And the best 
part is that both teams later adopted the same data-driven framework for future prioritization, which made conflicts 
a lot easier to resolve.

For me, the big takeaway was that conflict resolution isn’t just about facilitating discussion—it’s about bringing 
clarity, creating shared decision rules, and taking ownership of guiding everyone toward an objective outcome.

2. Formal Interview Summary (for hiring committee)
The candidate described a conflict between the Product and Infrastructure teams over resource allocation. They took ownership by gathering data on impact, estimates, and risks, and created a comparison model to facilitate decision-making. The candidate organized a structured decision review, setting clear criteria such as alignment with goals and business impact. They proposed a hybrid plan that allowed the Product team to meet their launch deadline while minimizing delays for Infrastructure. The resolution led to a 12% increase in user activation and a framework for future prioritization. The candidate demonstrated structured thinking and effective conflict resolution at a Junior-Mid level.

7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide more specific examples of how you personally contributed to the data gathering process?
2. How did you ensure that the data and criteria you set were accepted by both teams?
3. What challenges did you face while implementing the hybrid plan, and how did you address them?
4. Can you elaborate on how the 12% uplift in user activation was measured and attributed to the resolution?
5. How did you balance your time and responsibilities while managing this conflict resolution process?
6. What feedback did you receive from the teams after implementing the new framework for prioritization?
