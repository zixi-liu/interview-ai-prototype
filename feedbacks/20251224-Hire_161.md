**Rating**: Hire

## Question

What will be your course of action if you are assigned some task which you don’t know at all?

## Answer

When assigned a task involving unfamiliar technologies, I view it as a pivotal opportunity for growth and innovation, demonstrating a strong sense of ownership and commitment to excellence. In my previous role, I took the lead on a transformative initiative to transition our system from a monolithic architecture to a microservices framework, which aimed to enhance scalability and operational efficiency across the organization.

To kick off this project, I conducted a comprehensive assessment of our existing architecture, identifying critical knowledge gaps and areas for improvement. I dedicated over 15 hours in the first week to an intensive self-education program, utilizing official documentation, online courses, and community forums to build a solid foundation. Recognizing the importance of collaboration, I proactively engaged a senior colleague with extensive microservices experience. I came prepared with specific questions and conducted structured knowledge-sharing sessions, where I not only absorbed insights but also contributed my findings, fostering a culture of continuous improvement within our team.

I took full ownership of the pilot project that tested our microservices architecture in a controlled environment. I defined clear objectives and success metrics, specifically targeting a 30% improvement in system scalability and a 40% reduction in deployment times. Throughout the project, I facilitated regular feedback loops with team members, iterating on our implementation strategy based on real-time insights. By meticulously tracking these metrics, I communicated our progress effectively to both my manager and the broader team, ensuring alignment with our project goals.

One of the challenges I faced was the overwhelming amount of documentation related to microservices. To address this, I focused on the specific information necessary for the task at hand, which allowed me to navigate the learning curve more effectively. Additionally, I struggled with debugging during the transition; I overcame this by leveraging online communities and asking targeted questions, which helped me resolve issues more efficiently.

The successful implementation of the microservices architecture had a profound impact beyond my immediate team. I documented our processes and outcomes in detail and presented them at a company-wide meeting, which inspired other teams to adopt similar methodologies. This initiative not only promoted innovative practices across various projects but also established a framework for ongoing improvement throughout the organization.

This experience reinforced my belief that unfamiliar tasks are valuable opportunities for growth and innovation. I have developed a proven strategy for tackling such challenges while driving team success and fostering a collaborative culture that values learning and adaptation. Moving forward, I am committed to leveraging these experiences to influence and elevate our engineering practices, ensuring that our team remains agile and responsive to emerging technologies and methodologies, ultimately contributing to the broader success of the organization.

============================================================
5. Competency Ratings (use FAANG rubric)
- Ownership: 👍
- Problem Solving: 👍
- Execution: 👌
- Collaboration: 👍
- Communication: 👍
- Leadership / Influence: 👌
- Culture Fit: 👍

============================================================
6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 👍 Hire

The candidate shows a solid foundation in ownership and collaboration, with a structured approach to tackling unfamiliar tasks. However, the articulation of impact and independent problem-solving could be stronger. Overall, they demonstrate potential for growth and contribution at the Junior-Mid level.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide specific examples of how your contributions impacted teams outside of your immediate project?
2. What metrics did you use to measure the success of the microservices transition, and how did you arrive at those specific targets?
3. Can you describe a situation where you had to solve a problem independently without seeking help from others? What was the outcome?
4. How did you prioritize which documentation to focus on during your self-education phase, and what criteria did you use?
5. In your experience with the pilot project, what specific challenges did you face that required you to adapt your strategy? How did you handle them?
