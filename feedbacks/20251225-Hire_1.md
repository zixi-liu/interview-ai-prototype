**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Describe a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback. How did you handle it?

## Answer

In my role as a senior software developer at a tech company, I encountered a significant opportunity to provide constructive feedback to a junior developer, Alex, who was struggling with documentation—a critical component for our team's efficiency and scalability. Recognizing the profound impact that effective documentation has on both individual performance and team productivity, I took full ownership of the mentoring process, understanding that my guidance could lead to substantial improvements for Alex and the entire team.

I scheduled a one-on-one meeting with Alex in a supportive environment, where I began by praising his exceptional coding skills to build rapport and trust. I then articulated the importance of documentation, linking it directly to our team's success metrics, such as our previous 30% reduction in onboarding time and a 20% increase in project delivery speed. To ensure my feedback was actionable, I provided specific examples of well-documented code from our projects and shared tailored resources aimed at enhancing his documentation practices.

To facilitate structured improvement, I established clear objectives, targeting a 50% increase in the clarity and completeness of his documentation within two sprints. Initially, we conducted an audit of his work, revealing a documentation coverage of only 15%. This baseline allowed us to effectively track progress. I implemented regular review sessions, providing timely feedback on his drafts, and I made myself available for questions, emphasizing that he could reach out anytime for support. I also engaged in pair programming sessions where we documented code together, allowing him to observe my thought process in real-time.

The results were remarkable: over the next three months, Alex increased his documentation coverage to 75%. Additionally, the number of questions other developers asked about his code decreased from 3-4 per week to about 1 per month, and his pull requests were approved faster due to improved clarity. I shared these metrics with Alex during follow-up conversations, which he found motivating and reinforcing.

Recognizing the broader implications of this experience, I took the initiative to organize and lead a team workshop focused on documentation best practices. I presented data illustrating the positive impact of clear documentation on our workflow, resulting in a team-wide commitment to prioritize clarity and completeness. Post-workshop surveys indicated a 40% increase in team members' confidence in their documentation skills, and we observed a 20% improvement in project delivery timelines due to the enhanced documentation practices.

Throughout this process, I faced challenges, particularly initial resistance from Alex regarding the feedback. He expressed concerns about the perceived criticism of his work. I addressed this by using the 'sandwich method'—starting with praise for his problem-solving skills and framing the documentation issue as an opportunity for growth. I shared my own struggles with documentation early in my career, which helped him see that my intentions were to support his development rather than criticize him. I also encouraged him to express his thoughts, transforming the feedback into a collaborative effort.

This experience deepened my commitment to mentorship and highlighted the importance of delivering constructive feedback in a way that promotes growth and accountability. It equipped me with valuable insights that I continue to apply as I mentor other team members, ensuring our collective output remains high-quality and maintainable. By taking ownership of this mentoring initiative and driving measurable improvements across the organization, I demonstrated my ability to influence and enhance our team's performance, aligning with our goals for high performance and continuous learning.
