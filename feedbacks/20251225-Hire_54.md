# Red Flag Evaluation (20251225)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Have you ever been in a situation where another team and yours were creating a similar product? What happened?

## Answer

In my previous role as a Senior Software Engineer at a tech company, I encountered a critical situation where my team and another team were both developing automation tools for customer service, risking resource duplication and inconsistent customer experiences. Recognizing the potential impact on our customers and the organization, I took full ownership of the situation and initiated a strategic collaboration to unify our efforts.

I led the technical integration by designing the architecture for merging the two codebases, writing the integration layer myself, which comprised about 1,500 lines of code. I organized a kickoff meeting with the other team to facilitate discussions that aligned our project scopes and objectives. I created a detailed integration plan and timeline, breaking it down into phases, and coordinated the code review process to ensure both teams' code met quality standards. To drive successful execution, I established daily stand-ups, tracked progress in a shared project management tool, and made myself available to unblock team members.

To ensure we were making informed decisions, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of both tools, identifying key features and areas for improvement. My analysis revealed that by integrating the most impactful elements from each project, we could create a tool that would not only meet but exceed our initial goals. I communicated this effectively to secure alignment and buy-in from all stakeholders, ensuring everyone understood the benefits of collaboration.

When we encountered conflicting priorities and differing communication styles, I proactively facilitated weekly alignment sessions and created a shared dashboard to monitor our progress and key performance indicators. I implemented objective criteria for feature evaluation, focusing on user value, technical quality, and maintainability, which helped resolve conflicts and fostered a culture of constructive dialogue. I also prioritized team engagement by celebrating key milestones and encouraging open dialogue, which significantly boosted morale and collaboration.

As a direct result of our unified efforts, we successfully delivered a feature-rich tool that increased customer service efficiency by 30%, reduced response times by 40%, and elevated user satisfaction scores from 3.5 to 4.6 out of 5, as confirmed by customer feedback surveys. Additionally, 95% of agents were using the integrated tool within two weeks of launch, demonstrating strong adoption.

Reflecting on this experience, I learned the importance of involving both teams earlier in the planning process and establishing better communication channels from the start. While I took the lead on the integration plan, I recognize that more collaborative planning sessions would have enhanced our alignment. I also realized the value of celebrating small wins along the way and creating a structured process for handling disagreements, which would have made our collaboration smoother. Moving forward, I am committed to leveraging these lessons in future initiatives, ensuring that I continue to drive high-quality solutions that align with organizational goals and deliver measurable impact. This experience has reinforced my dedication to ownership, collaboration, and delivering results that resonate with both the team and the broader organization.
