## Question

Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a significant change at work. How did you adapt to this change?

## Answer

Situation: At my previous position as a software developer in a large tech company, our team was informed that we would be transitioning from our traditional monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture. This was a substantial shift in our approach to software development and required learning new technologies and methodologies. Task: As someone who had primarily worked with monolithic architectures, my task was not only to quickly upskill myself in microservices but also to contribute effectively to the transition process while maintaining my responsibilities on the existing codebase. Action: I took a proactive approach to this challenge. I enrolled in an online course on microservices architecture to build a solid theoretical understanding and dedicated specific time blocks for learning—mornings for theory and afternoons for practical application. I spent time outside of work hours, approximately 10-15 hours a week, experimenting with creating small microservices to gain practical experience. I also joined study groups within the company, where I prepared presentations on service communication patterns and distributed system challenges, helping my peers understand the 'why' behind microservices. To ensure my learning aligned with the team's goals, I had weekly check-ins with my manager to discuss my progress and focused my studies on upcoming projects that would benefit from microservices, such as load balancing and service discovery patterns. Throughout this transition, I maintained open communication with my team, sharing my progress and seeking feedback. Result: This proactive and immersive approach enabled me to adapt quickly to the change. I created a reusable service template that cut down the time to create a new microservice from about two weeks to just three days, which was utilized 15 times in the first three months. I also documented best practices that reduced support questions from 20-25 per week to about 5-8, and developed monitoring dashboards that decreased our mean time to detect problems from about two hours to just 15 minutes. My contributions led to an increase in our team's deployment frequency from weekly to daily, significantly improving our efficiency and the scalability of our applications. My ability to adapt and learn rapidly was recognized by my peers and superiors, and I was given the responsibility to lead a key microservice module in one of our major projects. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also demonstrated my ownership, adaptability, and eagerness to embrace new challenges, making a tangible impact on our team's success.
