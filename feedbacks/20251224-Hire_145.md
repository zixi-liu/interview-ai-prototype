## Question

How would you design/test a product to make sure its diverse/inclusive to all users?

## Answer

In my previous role as the lead engineer for a health and fitness app, I took full ownership of a comprehensive redesign initiative aimed at enhancing inclusivity and accessibility for our diverse user base. Recognizing the need to cater to various demographics, I initiated a robust user research program, conducting over 200 surveys, 15 in-depth interviews, and three focus groups specifically targeting individuals with disabilities and non-native English speakers. This thorough research allowed me to identify critical pain points, such as navigation difficulties and the absence of culturally relevant content, which I prioritized for immediate resolution.

To address these challenges, I led my team in embedding inclusive design principles throughout the development lifecycle. I personally championed the implementation of key features, including adjustable text sizes, high-contrast color schemes, and culturally sensitive content, ensuring our compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). I wrote the accessibility testing scripts and ran them using screen readers and other assistive technologies, and I created the WCAG compliance checklist to audit the app against it. I also contributed approximately 800 lines of code for the adjustable text size and high-contrast mode features. My strategic trade-offs prioritized features that maximized user experience while aligning with our technical capabilities and development timelines, ensuring our design efforts supported the company’s broader business objectives.

To validate our design choices, I established and led a diverse beta testing group of 30 individuals, conducting structured feedback sessions and one-on-one interviews to gather insights. I created structured feedback forms with specific questions, which improved the quality of feedback from an average score of 2.3/5 to 4.1/5. This iterative feedback process was crucial; I meticulously analyzed their responses, which directly informed a significant redesign of our navigation structure. As a result of my leadership, we achieved a 50% reduction in user-reported navigation issues and a 40% increase in overall usability ratings across all demographics. Additionally, we saw a 35% increase in users from underrepresented groups, and our app store rating improved from 3.4 to 4.6 stars, with many reviews specifically mentioning the accessibility features.

The impact of my leadership in this initiative was substantial. We recorded a 40% increase in user satisfaction ratings and a 30% boost in downloads within the first month of launch, significantly broadening our market reach and enhancing our brand image. Throughout the project, I faced challenges in gaining buy-in from the product team, who were initially concerned about the timeline impact and cost of inclusive design. I addressed this by presenting data from other companies demonstrating that inclusive design improves overall product quality and by creating a phased approach to implement high-impact, low-effort changes first, which showed quick wins.

This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of empathy in design and the value of diverse perspectives in creating products that serve all users. I am committed to fostering an inclusive culture in every team I join, leveraging my proactive leadership and collaboration skills to drive measurable outcomes. My focus on clear ownership and accountability, coupled with a data-driven approach to decision-making, ensures that I contribute effectively to both team success and organizational goals. I have learned that true leadership involves not only guiding a team but also embracing feedback and continuously evolving to meet the needs of all users, which I will carry forward into future projects.
