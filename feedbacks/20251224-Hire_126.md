**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a time when you had a hard time working with someone in your team. How did you handle it?

## Answer

In my previous role as a software engineer, I led a cross-functional team tasked with developing a new mobile application under a tight deadline. Early in the project, I identified that one of my team members, John, had a working style that often led to misalignment with our project objectives. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, I took full ownership of the challenge to ensure the project's success and foster a collaborative team environment.

I initiated a one-on-one meeting with John to better understand his perspective and working habits. During our discussion, I communicated our shared goals and emphasized the critical need for alignment. I reflected on my own communication style and recognized that I needed to adapt to better support John’s approach. I provided constructive feedback on how his isolated work style was impacting his productivity and the overall team dynamics. To facilitate better collaboration, I proposed structured weekly check-ins that were shorter and more focused, scheduled at times that worked for him, which helped address his initial resistance.

I also organized targeted team-building activities that were more work-related, such as pair programming sessions, rather than just social events. I documented my approach and the outcomes in our team retrospectives, which my manager reviewed, and I made sure to give credit to John for his willingness to adapt. This transparency helped enhance team recognition and morale.

These initiatives led to a measurable 40% increase in our collaborative output, as evidenced by our project management tool, where our project velocity improved from completing 8 story points per sprint to 12 story points per sprint. Additionally, team satisfaction scores improved from 3.1 to 4.4 out of 5 over two months, and the number of miscommunications decreased from about 3-4 per week to just 1. We completed the project two weeks ahead of schedule, resulting in a 15% increase in client satisfaction ratings, as highlighted in their feedback praising both the quality of the application and the improved team coordination.

This experience reinforced my belief in the power of empathy and proactive communication, while also emphasizing the importance of shared responsibility in team dynamics. By taking decisive ownership and driving these changes, I ensured that our project not only met but exceeded expectations, demonstrating my ability to positively influence outcomes across the team and significantly contribute to our shared success. This experience taught me valuable lessons about adaptability and the need to continuously assess and refine team dynamics for optimal performance, ultimately shaping me into a more effective leader.
