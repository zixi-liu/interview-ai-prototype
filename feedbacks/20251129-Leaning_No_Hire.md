## Question

Tell me about a time you solved a conflict.

## Answer

Certainly. In my previous role I found myself in the midst of a conflict 
regarding resource allocation for two critical projects within our development team.

The conflict arose when both the product development and infrastructure enhancement 
teams were vying for the same limited resources for their respective projects. 
I could empathise with both their perspectives but it seemed to me that many of 
the people involved were basing their arguments on their "gut feeling" around what was "fair".

Recognizing the potential disruption this conflict could cause, I organized a 
collaborative discussion involving representatives from both teams, project managers, 
and the leadership. During this discussion, we openly addressed the conflicting priorities 
and resource needs of each project. I encouraged a transparent sharing of data and information 
regarding the potential impact of both projects on the company's goals.

This way we were able to base our discussion around the data, rather than around people's 
subjective opinions and hunches.

By presenting a data-driven analysis and illustrating how each project aligned with the 
company's objectives, we were able to justify the resource allocation for both initiatives. 
The infrastructure team ended up with slightly less than they were hoping for, 
but presented with the data, they accepted that this was a fair distribution of resources. 
In the end, both projects progressed effectively.

Ultimately, this experience taught me how useful data can be in solving or avoiding these 
types of conflicts. When people are using opinion, hunches and emotions to make decisions, 
disagreements occur and they tend to feel more personal. But when the decision-making process 
is data-driven there is less room for subjective opinion and it becomes easier to align 
different stakeholders.

7. Final Overall Recommendation
- 🤔 Leaning No Hire

The candidate shows potential with structured thinking and a collaborative approach but lacks clear ownership and impact in their example. The ambiguity around the data used and the overall scope of influence raises concerns about their readiness for a more senior role.

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "executor-style contribution" (the candidate organized a discussion but did not demonstrate clear ownership of the outcome)
  - "lack of reflection" (the candidate does not reflect on their role in the conflict resolution process)
  - "vagueness" (the impact of the resolution on the projects is not quantified or clearly articulated)

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "executor-style contribution": ★★★☆☆
- "lack of reflection": ★★☆☆☆
- "vagueness": ★★★☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- Candidate's role appears more facilitative than ownership-driven, lacking clear personal impact.
- No metrics or specific outcomes provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resolution.
- Reflection on personal contribution and learning is insufficient for a Junior-Mid level candidate.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly articulate personal contributions and decisions made during the conflict resolution.
- Include specific metrics or outcomes that resulted from the resolution to demonstrate impact.
- Reflect on lessons learned and how they would apply them in future situations to show growth.
