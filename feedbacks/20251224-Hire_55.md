# Red Flag Evaluation (20251224)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a project that didn’t go according to plan.

## Answer

In my previous role as a software developer at a tech company, I took full ownership of leading the backend development of a new customer relationship management (CRM) system designed to optimize our sales process and enhance customer interactions. I was responsible for every aspect, from architecture design to deployment, ensuring seamless integration between backend components, the front-end system, and the database.

Midway through the project, we faced significant delays due to unforeseen technical challenges with integrating third-party APIs, which we had initially underestimated. Recognizing the critical nature of these issues, I prepared detailed analysis documents that outlined the bottlenecks and proposed solutions, including visual diagrams comparing our current architecture to the proposed changes. I organized and led structured cross-functional meetings with my backend team, front-end developers, and key stakeholders, where I presented my analysis clearly and encouraged input from others while ensuring my key points were heard. I followed up these meetings with written summaries to document our discussions and decisions.

To address the integration challenges, I proposed a strategic pivot in our technology stack for specific components to better align with the integration requirements. I tracked several key metrics, including sprint velocity, which had dropped from 15 story points to 8, and our completion rate, which was only 60% of planned work. I quantified the delay we were facing as 4 weeks behind schedule, which would have grown to 8 weeks without a change in approach. I also highlighted that integration issues were consuming 40% of our development time. Presenting these metrics to stakeholders helped illustrate the severity of the situation and secured their buy-in for the new direction.

Although we experienced a one-month delay, the adjustments ultimately led to the delivery of a more robust CRM system, which improved our sales team's efficiency by 25% within the first quarter of deployment. This experience reinforced my commitment to agile project management, proactive communication, and decisive leadership in overcoming obstacles. I learned the importance of fostering collaboration across teams to ensure that all perspectives are valued, driving us collectively toward successful outcomes.

Reflecting on this project, I recognize that while we achieved significant improvements, I could have further mitigated risks by conducting a more thorough initial assessment of the third-party APIs. In future projects, I plan to implement a structured risk assessment framework that includes detailed evaluations of external dependencies and their potential impact on timelines. I will also organize training sessions and provide resources to address any learning curves associated with new technologies, ensuring that all team members feel supported. This will not only enhance my leadership effectiveness but also cultivate an environment where innovation and problem-solving can thrive, ultimately driving better project outcomes.

## Feedback

============================================================
1. Real-Time Raw Notes (Interviewer's scratch notes)

- Demonstrated ability to lead meetings and document outcomes

============================================================
4. Areas for Improvement
- Need to clarify personal contributions vs. team efforts; some actions felt more executor-style.
- Could enhance initial risk assessment processes; more thorough evaluation of dependencies needed.
- Further detail on how they influenced team decisions and drove project outcomes.

============================================================
5. Competency Ratings (use FAANG rubric)
- Ownership: Meets(👌)
- Problem Solving: Meets+(👍)
- Execution: Meets(👌)
- Collaboration: Strong(🌟)
- Communication: Strong(🌟)
- Leadership / Influence: Meets(👌)

============================================================
6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 👍 Hire

The candidate demonstrated a solid understanding of project challenges and took appropriate actions to address them. However, there were areas where ownership and influence could be more clearly articulated. Overall, they show potential for growth and would be a reliable addition to the team.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide specific examples of how you influenced the decisions made in the cross-functional meetings?
2. What steps did you take to ensure that your proposed technology stack pivot was accepted by the team and stakeholders?
3. How did you assess the risks associated with the third-party APIs initially, and what specific metrics would you include in your future risk assessments?
4. Can you elaborate on your role in the project beyond leading the backend development? What specific contributions did you make that were pivotal to the project's success?
5. How did you ensure that all team members felt supported during the integration challenges, and what feedback did you receive from them?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - Overclaiming contribution: The candidate describes leading the backend development but does not clarify specific individual contributions versus team efforts.
  - Lack of reflection: While the candidate acknowledges a need for better initial assessments, there is insufficient detail on how this will be implemented or learned from.
  - Ambiguity avoidance: The candidate does not clearly define their role in the proposed pivot of the technology stack, making it difficult to assess personal ownership.

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- Overclaiming contribution: ★★☆☆☆
- Lack of reflection: ★★☆☆☆
- Ambiguity avoidance: ★★★☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification
- The candidate's ownership of the project is unclear, leading to potential ambiguity in their contributions.
- While metrics are mentioned, the impact of the candidate's actions on these metrics is not explicitly tied to their individual efforts.
- The reflection on future improvements lacks actionable specifics, which diminishes perceived growth potential.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly delineate individual contributions versus team efforts to demonstrate ownership.
- Provide specific examples of how the candidate plans to implement the structured risk assessment framework.
- Include quantifiable metrics tied directly to personal actions to strengthen the impact narrative.
