## Question

Tell me about a time you solved a conflict.

## Answer

Certainly. In my previous role I found myself in the midst of a conflict 
regarding resource allocation for two critical projects within our development team.

The conflict arose when both the product development and infrastructure enhancement 
teams were vying for the same limited resources for their respective projects. 
I could empathise with both their perspectives but it seemed to me that many of 
the people involved were basing their arguments on their "gut feeling" around what was "fair".

Recognizing the potential disruption this conflict could cause, I organized a 
collaborative discussion involving representatives from both teams, project managers, 
and the leadership. During this discussion, we openly addressed the conflicting priorities 
and resource needs of each project. I encouraged a transparent sharing of data and information 
regarding the potential impact of both projects on the company's goals.

This way we were able to base our discussion around the data, rather than around people's 
subjective opinions and hunches.

By presenting a data-driven analysis and illustrating how each project aligned with the 
company's objectives, we were able to justify the resource allocation for both initiatives. 
The infrastructure team ended up with slightly less than they were hoping for, 
but presented with the data, they accepted that this was a fair distribution of resources. 
In the end, both projects progressed effectively.

Ultimately, this experience taught me how useful data can be in solving or avoiding these 
types of conflicts. When people are using opinion, hunches and emotions to make decisions, 
disagreements occur and they tend to feel more personal. But when the decision-making process 
is data-driven there is less room for subjective opinion and it becomes easier to align 
different stakeholders.

6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 🤔 Leaning No Hire
The candidate showed potential in collaboration and problem-solving but lacked clear ownership and impact in their example. Their contributions appeared more facilitative rather than decisive, which does not meet the higher expectations for this level.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
- Ownership: "What was YOUR specific decision that changed the outcome of the resource allocation?"
- Reflection: "What mistake did you make during the conflict resolution process, and what would you do differently next time?"
- Metrics: "What specific metrics or outcomes can you share about YOUR contribution to the resolution of the conflict?"
- Impact: "Can you describe a situation where your actions directly influenced the outcome of a project?"
- Clarity: "How did you ensure that all stakeholders were aligned on the data presented during the discussion?"
- Personal Contribution: "What role did you play in shaping the final decision, and how did you ensure your perspective was heard?"

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Blames others: The candidate implies that others based their arguments on "gut feeling" rather than data, which could suggest a lack of empathy or understanding of team dynamics.
- Lack of reflection: The candidate does not reflect on their own role in the conflict or how they could have proactively prevented it.
- Ambiguity avoidance: The description lacks specific metrics or quantifiable outcomes related to the projects and resource allocation.

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- Blames others: ★★☆☆☆
- Lack of reflection: ★★★☆☆
- Ambiguity avoidance: ★★★☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate demonstrates some conflict resolution skills but shifts blame to others without taking ownership.
- There is a lack of personal reflection on their role in the conflict, which raises concerns about self-awareness.
- The absence of specific metrics or outcomes diminishes the strength of the example and raises questions about the impact of their actions.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Provide specific examples of personal contributions to resolving the conflict, emphasizing ownership.
- Reflect on what could have been done differently to prevent the conflict from arising.
- Include quantifiable outcomes or metrics to demonstrate the impact of the resolution on project success.
