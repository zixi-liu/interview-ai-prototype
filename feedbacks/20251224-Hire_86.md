# Red Flag Evaluation (20251224)

**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a time when you had a hard time working with someone in your team. How did you handle it?

## Answer

In my previous role as a software engineer, I led a cross-functional team tasked with developing a new mobile application under a tight deadline. Early in the project, I recognized that one of my team members, John, had a working style that often led to misalignment with our project objectives, which posed a risk to our timeline and deliverables. Acknowledging the urgency of the situation, I took full ownership of the challenge and committed to resolving it effectively to ensure both the project's success and a harmonious team environment.

I scheduled a one-on-one meeting with John to gain insight into his perspective and working habits. During our conversation, I clearly articulated our shared goals and the critical importance of alignment for our collective success. I provided specific, constructive feedback on how his isolated approach was impacting not only his productivity but also the overall team dynamics and our project timeline. To foster better collaboration, I proposed structured weekly check-ins that aligned with his preferred work style while ensuring we remained focused on our objectives. I made these check-ins shorter and more focused, scheduling them at times that worked for him to minimize disruption.

Additionally, I organized targeted team-building activities that were more work-related, such as pair programming sessions, to enhance trust and communication among all team members. I tracked several metrics to measure our progress: team satisfaction scores improved from 3.1 to 4.4 out of 5 over two months, the number of miscommunications decreased from about 3-4 per week to maybe 1 per week, and our project velocity increased from completing 8 story points per sprint to 12 story points per sprint. The client feedback specifically mentioned improved team coordination, and we completed the project two weeks ahead of schedule, resulting in a 15% increase in client satisfaction ratings.

Throughout this process, I documented my approach and the outcomes in our team retrospective, which my manager reviewed. I made sure to give credit to John for being willing to adapt, which helped with recognition and fostered a positive team dynamic. This experience reinforced my belief in the power of empathy and proactive communication while highlighting the importance of structured collaboration. By taking decisive ownership and driving these changes, I ensured that our project not only met but exceeded expectations, demonstrating my ability to influence outcomes positively across the team and significantly contribute to our shared success. I learned valuable lessons about adaptability and the need to continuously assess and refine team dynamics for optimal performance, and I would approach similar challenges in the future by establishing clearer metrics from the start and involving the team in designing solutions collaboratively.

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "overclaiming contribution" - The candidate attributes significant project success to their own actions without adequately clarifying the contributions of others, particularly John.
  - "vagueness" - While metrics are provided, the candidate does not specify how their actions directly led to the improvements, leaving room for ambiguity regarding their individual impact.

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
