# Red Flag Evaluation (20251128)

## Question

Tell me about a time you solved a conflict.

## Answer

Certainly. In my previous role I found myself in the midst of a conflict 
regarding resource allocation for two critical projects within our development team.

The conflict arose when both the product development and infrastructure enhancement 
teams were vying for the same limited resources for their respective projects. 
I could empathise with both their perspectives but it seemed to me that many of 
the people involved were basing their arguments on their "gut feeling" around what was "fair".

Recognizing the potential disruption this conflict could cause, I organized a 
collaborative discussion involving representatives from both teams, project managers, 
and the leadership. During this discussion, we openly addressed the conflicting priorities 
and resource needs of each project. I encouraged a transparent sharing of data and information 
regarding the potential impact of both projects on the company's goals.

This way we were able to base our discussion around the data, rather than around people's 
subjective opinions and hunches.

By presenting a data-driven analysis and illustrating how each project aligned with the 
company's objectives, we were able to justify the resource allocation for both initiatives. 
The infrastructure team ended up with slightly less than they were hoping for, 
but presented with the data, they accepted that this was a fair distribution of resources. 
In the end, both projects progressed effectively.

Ultimately, this experience taught me how useful data can be in solving or avoiding these 
types of conflicts. When people are using opinion, hunches and emotions to make decisions, 
disagreements occur and they tend to feel more personal. But when the decision-making process 
is data-driven there is less room for subjective opinion and it becomes easier to align 
different stakeholders.

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "lack of reflection" - The candidate does not demonstrate personal accountability or reflection on their role in the conflict resolution process.
  - "ambiguity avoidance" - The candidate's description lacks clarity on their specific contributions and decision-making authority in the collaborative discussion.
  - "overclaiming contribution" - The candidate implies a significant impact on the outcome without clear evidence of their individual influence on the final decision.

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "lack of reflection" - ★★☆☆☆
- "ambiguity avoidance" - ★★★☆☆
- "overclaiming contribution" - ★★★☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's response lacks clear ownership of the resolution process, making it difficult to assess their individual impact.
- The ambiguity in their role raises concerns about their ability to navigate complex team dynamics effectively.
- The absence of specific metrics or quantifiable outcomes weakens the overall effectiveness of their data-driven approach.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly articulate specific actions taken during the conflict resolution process to demonstrate ownership.
- Provide quantifiable results or metrics to support the effectiveness of the data-driven decisions made.
- Reflect on personal contributions and lessons learned to show growth and accountability in team dynamics.
