## Question

Tell me about a time when you had a hard time working with someone in your team. How did you handle it?

## Answer

In my previous role as a software engineer, I led a cross-functional team tasked with developing a mobile application under a tight deadline. Early in the project, I identified that one of my team members, John, had a working style that was misaligned with our project objectives, which threatened our timeline and overall success. Recognizing the critical nature of this issue, I took full ownership of the situation and initiated a proactive approach to resolve it.

I scheduled a one-on-one meeting with John to understand his perspective and working habits better. During our discussion, I emphasized the importance of alignment with our shared goals and how his approach was impacting both his productivity and the team's dynamics. I actively listened to his concerns and adapted my communication style to ensure he felt valued and understood. This open dialogue allowed us to collaboratively pinpoint specific areas for improvement.

To enhance our collaboration, I introduced structured weekly check-ins that aligned with John's preferred working style, establishing clear accountability and focus. Initially, John was resistant to more frequent check-ins, perceiving them as disruptive. I addressed this by making the check-ins shorter and more focused, scheduling them at times that worked for him. Additionally, I organized targeted team-building activities that were work-related, such as pair programming sessions, rather than purely social activities. I also shared data demonstrating how collaboration improved after these initiatives, which helped overcome any resistance.

As a result of these initiatives, I tracked several metrics that demonstrated our success: team satisfaction scores improved from 3.1 to 4.4 out of 5 over two months, the number of miscommunications decreased from about 3-4 per week to 1 per week, and our code review turnaround time improved significantly as John became more responsive. Moreover, our project velocity increased from completing 8 story points per sprint to 12 story points per sprint. Client feedback specifically praised our improved team coordination, which was a direct reflection of our enhanced collaboration.

Throughout this process, I documented my approach and the outcomes in our team retrospectives, which my manager reviewed. I made sure to give credit to John for his willingness to adapt, reinforcing a culture of recognition within the team. My manager acknowledged my role in improving team collaboration during my performance review, highlighting the positive impact of my leadership.

This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of empathy, proactive communication, and adaptability in leadership. I learned the value of regularly assessing team dynamics and taking responsibility for fostering a collaborative environment. By decisively owning the situation and implementing these changes, I ensured our project not only met but exceeded expectations. This has equipped me with the skills necessary to navigate complex team interactions and drive successful project outcomes, aligning closely with the values and expectations of a senior role in a FAANG company.
