**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a time when you had to prioritize your tasks quickly.

## Answer

In my previous role as a Senior Software Developer at a high-growth tech startup, I faced a critical situation when a significant bug was causing our top client's system to crash every 2-3 hours, impacting around 200 daily users and posing a potential revenue loss of up to $100,000. Recognizing the urgency, I took full ownership of the situation and led the response. I organized an emergency meeting with my team, where I clearly communicated the bug's implications, including the estimated downtime and the necessity to prioritize the bug fix over ongoing feature development to protect our client's interests.

During the meeting, I facilitated a focused discussion to establish clear objectives and assigned specific responsibilities to each team member, ensuring everyone understood their role in resolving the issue. I personally conducted a thorough root cause analysis within two hours, identifying the core issue behind the disruption. I then coordinated the implementation of a fix, overseeing the deployment of a patch that restored full functionality for the client within the same day, reducing their downtime to just 30 minutes. This decisive action not only exceeded the client’s expectations but also led to a significant drop in their support ticket volume related to this issue from 15-20 tickets per day to zero. The client even sent us a thank-you email, stating that the fix saved them from potential data loss that could have cost them around $10,000. Additionally, our account manager informed me that this quick response was a key factor in the client renewing their annual contract with us.

After addressing the immediate crisis, I recognized the need to maintain our development momentum while ensuring quality. I developed a structured plan that broke down the remaining tasks into smaller, manageable components, set clear deadlines, and assigned specific responsibilities to each team member. I communicated the priority change through our team Slack channel and updated our project management board, ensuring transparency and alignment within the team. This approach fostered accountability and collaboration, allowing us to meet our original release schedule without compromising quality. The collaborative effort culminated in the timely delivery of the feature, and the client expressed their appreciation for our responsiveness and dedication.

To prevent similar issues in the future, I initiated the implementation of enhanced testing protocols, which included automated regression tests and comprehensive code reviews. I tracked the effectiveness of these changes by monitoring bug recurrence rates and team efficiency metrics, which demonstrated a 40% reduction in critical issues over the following months. I also reflected on my leadership style and recognized the importance of asking for help earlier and communicating timelines more clearly. I learned that delegating tasks and prioritizing quick fixes before thorough solutions could save valuable time. Moving forward, I plan to leverage these insights to enhance our team's efficiency and strengthen client relationships in future projects, ensuring that I continue to drive measurable impact and foster a culture of excellence.
