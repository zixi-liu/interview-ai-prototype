## Question

Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a significant change at work. How did you adapt to this change?

## Answer

In my previous role as a software developer at a large tech company, we faced a pivotal transition from a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture aimed at significantly enhancing our system's scalability and performance. Recognizing the critical nature of this shift, I took full ownership of my responsibilities and led multiple initiatives to ensure a successful transition.

To equip myself for this transformation, I proactively enrolled in an advanced online course on microservices architecture, which provided me with a solid theoretical foundation. I dedicated personal time to develop several small microservices, applying my learning in practical scenarios. Identifying a gap in our team's knowledge-sharing practices, I initiated structured study groups that fostered collaboration and encouraged team members to share insights and challenges. This initiative resulted in a measurable 30% increase in team engagement during our sprint retrospectives, as members felt more empowered to contribute. I facilitated discussions by preparing presentations on service communication patterns and distributed system challenges, which helped clarify complex concepts for my teammates.

Throughout the transition, I maintained open and transparent communication with both my team and management. I provided regular updates on my progress, actively sought feedback, and adapted our strategies based on input to ensure alignment with our project goals. My leadership was particularly evident when I spearheaded the development of a critical microservice module for one of our flagship projects. I created a reusable service template that cut down the time to create a new microservice from about two weeks to three days, which was utilized 15 times in the first three months. I also wrote documentation and best practices guides that reduced support questions from 20-25 per week to about 5-8 per week. This proactive approach not only streamlined our processes but also ensured that our design adhered to best practices while meeting business requirements.

One of the most significant challenges we encountered was integrating legacy systems with the new microservices architecture. I led a focused effort to map out dependencies and developed a phased migration strategy that minimized disruptions. I personally tackled the most complex integration issues, collaborating closely with the legacy systems team to ensure a smooth transition. Additionally, I created monitoring dashboards that reduced our mean time to detect problems from about two hours to 15 minutes, further enhancing our operational efficiency.

The impact of our transition was substantial. Within three months, we achieved a 50% increase in deployment frequency, moving from weekly to daily deployments, and a 40% reduction in system downtime, directly enhancing our application's scalability and performance. My contributions, particularly in developing key features that improved system reliability and efficiency, were instrumental in achieving these outcomes. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also reinforced my ability to lead and adapt in the face of significant change, demonstrating my unwavering commitment to our team's success and the broader objectives of the organization. I learned the importance of resilience and adaptability, as well as the value of practical application in learning, and I am proud to have played a key role in driving our team’s transformation during this critical period.
