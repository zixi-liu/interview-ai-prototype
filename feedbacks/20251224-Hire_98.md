**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Assume you are given a task to design a system. How would you do it? How would you resolve ambiguity?

## Answer

When tasked with designing a system, I take a proactive and strategic approach that emphasizes ownership, clarity, and measurable outcomes. I initiate the process by conducting comprehensive stakeholder interviews and workshops to gather diverse perspectives, ensuring that we define clear expectations and identify critical requirements. For instance, in a recent project to overhaul our customer onboarding process, I facilitated targeted sessions that resulted in 30 well-defined requirements, aligning with user needs and supporting our strategic business objectives.

After gathering requirements, I led a thorough feasibility study, evaluating various technology stacks and compliance considerations. I determined that a microservices architecture was the optimal solution, which allowed us to scale different components independently and handle 5x more traffic without major infrastructure changes. This decision projected a 40% reduction in deployment times, as services could be deployed independently, reducing deployment time from 2 hours to just 15 minutes. I measured the impact of this architecture by tracking system performance, which improved response times by 40%, and development velocity, where independent team work reduced merge conflicts by 60%.

I then developed a detailed design proposal, including system architecture diagrams, data flow charts, and user interface wireframes. I organized and led stakeholder review meetings, where I presented our design and actively solicited feedback. During these sessions, I navigated ambiguities by facilitating discussions that prioritized requirements based on user impact and business value. For instance, when stakeholders expressed conflicting priorities, I created a priority matrix that balanced impact versus effort, allowing us to reach a consensus that improved user engagement metrics by 25%.

Taking full ownership of the project, I created extensive documentation, including technical specifications and user stories, which served as a clear roadmap for the development team. I ensured that my design decisions were well-documented and communicated effectively, sharing a design document that outlined my reasoning and incorporating team input. I utilized collaboration tools like Slack and Confluence to maintain transparent communication, ensuring all team members were aligned and informed throughout the project lifecycle.

Throughout the project, I faced challenges, such as the need to simplify aspects of my design to meet stakeholder expectations. I handled this by engaging in detailed discussions about trade-offs, advocating for long-term benefits while remaining flexible to stakeholder concerns. This collaborative approach led to a successful compromise that maintained critical scalability while simplifying the overall system.

As a result of my strategic approach and decisive ownership, we achieved a 30% reduction in onboarding time and a 20% increase in customer satisfaction scores. By effectively influencing cross-functional teams and ensuring alignment with organizational goals, I delivered a technically robust product that met user needs. This experience highlights my ability to lead impactful initiatives while fostering a collaborative environment, continuous learning, and innovation in system design.

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "overclaiming contribution" - The candidate's role in the project appears inflated, as they describe leading multiple initiatives without clear evidence of individual ownership or decision-making.
  - "ambiguity avoidance" - While the candidate mentions resolving ambiguities, the description lacks specific examples of how they navigated complex situations or conflicting stakeholder priorities beyond creating a priority matrix.
  - "lack of reflection" - The candidate does not demonstrate learning from challenges faced during the project, which is critical for growth in a Junior-Mid level role.

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "overclaiming contribution" - ★★★☆☆
- "ambiguity avoidance" - ★★☆☆☆
- "lack of reflection" - ★★☆☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's description of their contributions lacks clarity on individual ownership and decision-making.
- There is insufficient evidence of navigating complex ambiguities effectively.
- The response does not reflect on personal growth or lessons learned from challenges faced.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions (very concise)
- Provide specific examples of personal decision-making and ownership in the project.
- Include details on how ambiguities were specifically addressed and resolved.
- Reflect on lessons learned from challenges encountered during the project to demonstrate growth.
