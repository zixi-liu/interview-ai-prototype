**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Assume you are given a task to design a system. How would you do it? How would you resolve ambiguity?

## Answer

When given the task to design a system, I take a proactive and structured approach that emphasizes clear ownership, strategic problem-solving, and measurable impact. I begin by conducting in-depth stakeholder interviews and workshops to gather diverse perspectives and ensure alignment on objectives. For instance, in a recent initiative to overhaul our customer onboarding process, I organized and facilitated a series of workshops that led to the identification of 30 critical requirements. This thorough engagement not only aligned with our strategic goals but also directly addressed user pain points, resulting in a design that significantly enhanced user experience.

After gathering requirements, I led a comprehensive feasibility study where I evaluated various technology stacks and compliance considerations. I determined that adopting a microservices architecture would be optimal, projecting a 40% reduction in response times and enabling us to handle 5x more traffic without major infrastructure changes. This decision was backed by data from previous projects, where similar architectures demonstrated substantial performance gains, including a reduction in deployment time from 2 hours to just 15 minutes.

I crafted a detailed design proposal that included system architecture diagrams, data flow charts, and user interface wireframes. I organized stakeholder review meetings where I presented our design and actively solicited feedback, addressing ambiguities through structured discussions. For example, when a stakeholder expressed concerns about complexity, I facilitated a discussion that balanced their need for simplicity with the long-term benefits of scalability. This collaborative approach not only refined our design but also fostered a sense of ownership among team members, resulting in a 25% improvement in user engagement metrics.

Taking full ownership of the project, I developed comprehensive documentation, including technical specifications and user stories, which served as a clear roadmap for the development team. I utilized collaboration tools like Slack and Confluence to maintain transparent communication, ensuring that all team members were aligned and informed throughout the project lifecycle. My leadership was pivotal in cultivating a culture of collaboration; I encouraged team contributions, recognized individual efforts, and facilitated knowledge sharing, which significantly boosted team morale and productivity.

During the project, I encountered challenges such as conflicting stakeholder priorities. To address these complexities, I created a priority matrix that illustrated impact versus effort and facilitated discussions where stakeholders could agree on priorities. I also employed user personas and use cases to help stakeholders understand the underlying needs, not just the surface requests. As a result of my strategic approach and decisive ownership, we achieved a 30% reduction in onboarding time and a 20% increase in customer satisfaction scores. By effectively influencing cross-functional teams and ensuring alignment with organizational goals, I delivered a technically robust product that met user needs. This experience highlights my ability to lead impactful initiatives while fostering a collaborative environment, continuous learning, and innovation in system design.

3. Can you elaborate on a time when you had to independently resolve a conflict among stakeholders? What steps did you take?
4. What strategies do you use to ensure that all team members understand their roles and responsibilities in a project?
5. How do you prioritize tasks when faced with multiple conflicting stakeholder requests? Can you give a specific example?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Overclaiming contribution: The candidate presents a highly collaborative project but does not clearly delineate their individual contributions versus the team’s efforts.
- Lack of reflection: The candidate does not discuss any personal learnings or areas for improvement from the project, which is critical for growth.
- Ambiguity avoidance: While the candidate mentions resolving ambiguities, the methods described lack specificity and do not demonstrate a clear strategy for handling uncertainty.

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- Overclaiming contribution: ★★★☆☆
- Lack of reflection: ★★☆☆☆
- Ambiguity avoidance: ★★★☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's response lacks clear ownership of individual contributions, making it difficult to assess their impact.
- There is no reflection on personal growth or lessons learned, which is essential for a Junior-Mid level role.
- The approach to resolving ambiguity is vague and does not demonstrate a strong problem-solving mindset.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions
- Clearly articulate individual contributions and decisions made during the project to demonstrate ownership.
- Include reflections on personal learnings or challenges faced to show growth potential.
- Provide specific examples of how ambiguities were resolved with concrete strategies or frameworks.
