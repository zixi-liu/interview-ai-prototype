## Question

Why do you want to change your current company?

## Answer

I have had a very rewarding experience at my current company, where I've grown both professionally and technically. Over the years, I led a project to optimize our API performance, which improved response times by 65% and reduced infrastructure costs by $40,000 per year. I measured success using several metrics: average response time dropped from 800ms to 280ms, the error rate decreased from 2% to 0.3%, and cost per request was reduced by 45%. User satisfaction scores also increased from 3.2 to 4.5 out of 5, and the project was recognized as a major success during our quarterly review. 

I am now seeking a new challenge to further expand my skills, particularly in machine learning and AI. I believe this is a natural extension of my experience with data processing and analytics, where I've worked with large datasets and understand data pipelines. I am eager to learn how to apply ML to solve business problems, especially in improving user experiences and automating decision-making.

In my current role, I also faced a critical production issue where our system was crashing under load. As the lead developer, I diagnosed the root cause related to our database connection pooling and refactored the connection management code, stabilizing the system from crashing every few hours to running smoothly for weeks. This experience reinforced my problem-solving skills and my ability to coordinate effectively with my team.

Collaboration is key to my work approach. I proactively communicate to ensure alignment among team members. For instance, I organized a meeting between the frontend and backend teams to clarify assumptions about the API contract, which prevented significant rework later. I also created a shared document to track our decisions, helping keep everyone on the same page and building trust within the team.

Your company excites me because of its focus on innovative projects that align with my interests in [specific technologies]. I see my experience in [specific area] being valuable, as I've built similar systems before and am particularly interested in contributing to [specific project]. I believe my background in [specific technology] and my experience with [specific methodology] will allow me to make a meaningful impact on your team. I am looking forward to the learning opportunities this role presents and am eager to contribute to your projects.
