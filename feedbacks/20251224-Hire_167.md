**Rating**: Hire

## Question

Tell me about a time when you had a hard time working with someone in your team. How did you handle it?

## Answer

In my previous role as a software engineer, I led a cross-functional team tasked with developing a new mobile application under a tight deadline. Early in the project, I recognized that one of my team members, John, had a working style that often led to misalignment with our project objectives, which posed a risk to our timeline. Understanding the critical nature of our goals, I took full ownership of the situation and initiated a series of strategic actions to realign our efforts.

I arranged a one-on-one meeting with John to gain insight into his perspective and working habits. During this discussion, I clearly articulated our shared objectives and the importance of alignment for our success. I recognized that my communication style needed to adapt to better support John’s approach, as he preferred written communication over verbal discussions. I started sending detailed written updates and questions instead of relying solely on verbal communication. This adjustment not only made our interactions more effective but also allowed John time to process information before responding.

To foster collaboration, I proposed structured weekly check-ins that aligned with his preferred working style, ensuring we remained focused on our goals. Initially, John was resistant to more frequent check-ins, viewing them as disruptive. I addressed this by making the check-ins shorter and more focused, scheduling them at times that worked for him. I also organized targeted team-building activities, such as pair programming sessions, which were more work-related and helped improve trust and communication among all team members.

As a result of these initiatives, I tracked several key metrics that demonstrated our progress: team satisfaction scores improved from 3.1 to 4.4 out of 5 over two months, the number of miscommunications decreased from about 3-4 per week to maybe 1 per week, and code review turnaround time improved significantly as John became more responsive. Additionally, our project velocity increased from completing 8 story points per sprint to 12 story points per sprint. This improvement enabled us to complete the project two weeks ahead of schedule, which directly contributed to a 15% increase in client satisfaction ratings, as reflected in their feedback praising both the quality of the application and the enhanced teamwork throughout the development process.

This experience reinforced my belief in the power of empathy and proactive communication in leadership. By decisively owning the situation and implementing these changes, I ensured that our project not only met but exceeded expectations. I learned the importance of continuous assessment of team dynamics and adaptability, which has shaped me into a more effective leader capable of influencing positive outcomes across teams and significantly contributing to our organizational goals. Moving forward, I plan to set clearer metrics from the start for any team interventions and involve the team in designing solutions to ensure buy-in and effectiveness.

2. Formal Interview Summary (for hiring committee)
The candidate described a scenario where they led a cross-functional team to develop a mobile application under a tight deadline. They identified misalignment with a team member, John, and took ownership by initiating one-on-one discussions to adapt communication styles and implement structured check-ins. The candidate's actions resulted in improved team satisfaction, reduced miscommunications, and increased project velocity, ultimately leading to the project being completed ahead of schedule. While the candidate demonstrated effective problem-solving and collaboration, the ownership level could be further clarified.

6. Final Overall Recommendation
- 👍 Hire

The candidate demonstrated strong problem-solving and collaboration skills, with a clear understanding of team dynamics and effective communication strategies. However, there were some ambiguities regarding personal ownership, which slightly lowered the overall impression. They would likely fit well within a Junior-Mid level role, contributing positively to team objectives.

============================================================
7. Probing Follow-up Questions
1. Can you provide a specific example of a decision you made during the one-on-one with John that directly impacted the project's outcome?
2. How did you measure the effectiveness of the changes you implemented, and what specific role did you play in those measurements?
3. Were there any challenges you faced in getting team buy-in for the new communication methods, and how did you address them personally?
4. Can you elaborate on how you tracked the metrics you mentioned? What was your specific contribution to those improvements?
5. In hindsight, what would you have done differently to ensure even greater ownership of the project outcomes?

## Red Flag

=====================
1. Red Flag Detection
- Red Flags: 
  - "executor-style contribution" (the candidate primarily describes actions taken by others rather than their own direct impact)
  - "lack of reflection" (the candidate does not demonstrate personal growth or lessons learned beyond the project context)

=====================
2. Red Flag Severity Rating
- "executor-style contribution": ★★★☆☆
- "lack of reflection": ★★☆☆☆

=====================
3. Short Justification (Interviewer Tone)
- The candidate's role appears to be more of a facilitator rather than a decisive leader, lacking clear ownership of outcomes.
- Reflection on personal growth is limited, focusing instead on team metrics without deeper insights into personal development.
- Overall impact seems constrained to team dynamics rather than broader organizational influence.

=====================
4. Improvement Suggestions (very concise)
- Clearly articulate specific contributions and decisions made that directly influenced project outcomes.
- Include personal reflections on how the experience shaped future approaches to teamwork and leadership.
- Provide more explicit metrics related to personal performance or leadership effectiveness, not just team results.
